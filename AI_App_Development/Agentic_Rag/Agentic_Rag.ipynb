Whether you’re opting for a sole proprietorship, partnership, or limited liability company, this decision will have legal implications for your business.  Next, register your business name and structure with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), which will provide you with a certificate of incorporation. Don’t overlook taxes.  Register your business with the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to secure a tax identification number (TIN). State and local authorities also require registration for business permits or licences. Ensure you’re fully compliant.  The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) and the Vehicle Inspection Office (VIO) are other vital entities to register your vehicles and drivers with. They’ll provide a vehicle licence, driver’s licence, and roadworthiness certificate.  https://nvis.frsc.gov.ng/VehicleManagement/RegisterVehicle  Finally, consider registering with pertinent transport associations and unions for a membership card or sticker.  Types of Licenses and Permits The licenses and permits required for a transport business in Nigeria vary, but here are some key ones:  State Transport Authorities (STA) License: This regulatory licence is for intra-state transport operators. An example is the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA). National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) Permit: A union permit for road transport operators. Lagos State Drivers’ Institute (LASDRI) Card: A training and certification card for drivers in Lagos State.    Steps to Registering  an Inland Waterway Transport Business in Nigeria  Registration of Shipping Company and Ships It is important to seek legal advice while undertaking registration of a shipping company. This is because regulations and requirements vary based on the type of shipping company and several other factors. However, registration of a shipping company will generally necessitate the following actions: 1. Business Name Registration: It is important to register a business name in Nigeria to avoid losing a desired name to competitors and also ensure regulatory compliance as one cannot carry out a business without registration of same.[i] A business name can be registered as a sole proprietorship or partnership.[ii] Where the prospective shipping company is a jointly owned business not bearing partners' true names, is an individual-owned business not reflecting the owner's true name, or has a business name that differs from its corporate name, then it is mandated that it business name be registered before starting a business. To register a business, first, check for the availability of the desired name on the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) application portal. If approved, the CAC reserves the name for 60 days, within which you must then complete online forms with business details like nature, address, and owner information. Next, filing fees must be paid to the CAC using the Remita platform on the Company Registration Portal (CPR). Lastly, upload the required documents including passport photograph, signature, and valid identification card of the owner/partner. Once a Business Name is approved, it is entered into the CAC Register and a registration certificate is issued, including a unique Business Name Number.[iii] This certificate must be prominently displayed at the principal place of business. 2. Company Incorporation: Once you have registered your business name, you can then incorporate the company with the CAC by submitting required documents like the Memorandum and Articles of Association, and fulfilling other requirements, in compliance with the provisions of the provisions of the law.  3. Registration of Shipping Company: To qualify for a shipping license, a company must primarily engage in shipping and provide a completed NIMASA Form 1, tax clearance certificate, certified copies of Form CAC 7, Certificate of Incorporation, and Memorandum and Article of Association with a minimum share capital of N25 million dedicated to shipping. Also, the company is required to submit its latest audited report, CAC Form 2.1 if applicable, evidence of annual returns filing, registration as a Licensed Customs Agent, joint venture agreement if applicable, charter party agreement if applicable, and a bank reference. The procedure for registration is that the shipping company or its agent submits its application to the General Manager of either the Western or Eastern Ports. Upon submission, a debit note will be received to pay 200,000. After payment confirmation, the Nigerian Port Authority (NPA) issues a receipt. Subsequently, the NPA provides the original Certificate of Registration. The registration license is then issued within two weeks, contingent upon the company providing all required documents as listed  https://nimasa.gov.ng/services/ship-registration/bove. 4. Fulfilment of Tax Obligations: It is important to obtain Tax clearance and a Tax Identification Number (TIN) from the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) before starting operations. Importantly, regardless of registration status, taxation obligations cannot be overlooked. 5. Compliance with NIMASA Regulations: It is also important to take steps to ensure compliance with the maritime safety and security regulations set by the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA). Such regulations include the Merchant Shipping (Manning) Regulations 2010, the Safe Man Hours Work and Watch Keep Regulations 2010, and other directives of NIMASA. 6. Marking of Ships: Another action to take while setting up your shipping company is to permanently mark the ships as follows: the ship’s name on both bows and the stem, along with the port of registry; the official number and registered tonnage on the main beam; and the ship’s draught of water scale on each side of the stem and stem post.[v] These markings must be maintained without alteration, except for necessary changes where lawfully provided. Failure to keep the ship properly marked or tampering with the markings, except under specific circumstances, is an offence. 7. Registration of Ships: There is an obligation to register any ship owned wholly by persons qualified to own a registered Nigerian ship, except where such is exempted.[vi] To register a ship in Nigeria, a formal written application must be submitted to the Registrar at a Nigerian port of registry in an approved format. The application, whether from an individual or a corporation, must include the necessary information and documentation such as the purchaser's details, evidence of their ability to operate the vessel, ownership shares, bill of sale for previously registered ships, ship's log-book, proof of financial resources, and the corporation's certificate of incorporation and Articles of Association. If an agent is involved, their authority must be documented accordingly.  Article 91 of UNCLOS 111(1982) requires every state to issue ships which it has granted the rights to fly its flag a document to that effect which is known as the “certificate of registry”. The Nigerian Ship Registration Office (NSRO) is empowered to register ships in accordance with the following Acts: I. Merchant Shipping Act. S. 5-81 (part ii & iii)  II. NIMASA Act 2007 S. 28-32 (part viii) III.

Licensing and Permit: Another important step is to secure the required licenses and permits from relevant authorities, such as NIMASA and the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA). 9. Compliance with Local Content Requirements: Lastly, it is important to take steps to adhere to any applicable local content requirements, which refer to regulations mandating a certain percentage of goods, services, or personnel to be sourced locally. MINIMUM SHARE CAPITAL FOR VESSEL OWNERS (COMPANIES ONLY)  The minimum share capital for any vessel owned by a Nigerian company is N25,000,000.00 RESERVATION AND APPROVAL OF SHIP NAMES The Application for Registration allows an owner to specify a preferred name for a ship and any alternatives, should the preferred name be unavailable.

Steps to Registering  an Inland Waterway Transport Business in Nigeria  Registration of Shipping Company and Ships It is important to seek legal advice while undertaking registration of a shipping company. This is because regulations and requirements vary based on the type of shipping company and several other factors. However, registration of a shipping company will generally necessitate the following actions: 1. Business Name Registration: It is important to register a business name in Nigeria to avoid losing a desired name to competitors and also ensure regulatory compliance as one cannot carry out a business without registration of same.[i] A business name can be registered as a sole proprietorship or partnership.[ii] Where the prospective shipping company is a jointly owned business not bearing partners' true names, is an individual-owned business not reflecting the owner's true name, or has a business name that differs from its corporate name, then it is mandated that it business name be registered before starting a business. To register a business, first, check for the availability of the desired name on the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) application portal. If approved, the CAC reserves the name for 60 days, within which you must then complete online forms with business details like nature, address, and owner information. Next, filing fees must be paid to the CAC using the Remita platform on the Company Registration Portal (CPR). Lastly, upload the required documents including passport photograph, signature, and valid identification card of the owner/partner. Once a Business Name is approved, it is entered into the CAC Register and a registration certificate is issued, including a unique Business Name Number.[iii] This certificate must be prominently displayed at the principal place of business. 2. Company Incorporation: Once you have registered your business name, you can then incorporate the company with the CAC by submitting required documents like the Memorandum and Articles of Association, and fulfilling other requirements, in compliance with the provisions of the provisions of the law.  3. Registration of Shipping Company: To qualify for a shipping license, a company must primarily engage in shipping and provide a completed NIMASA Form 1, tax clearance certificate, certified copies of Form CAC 7, Certificate of Incorporation, and Memorandum and Article of Association with a minimum share capital of N25 million dedicated to shipping. Also, the company is required to submit its latest audited report, CAC Form 2.1 if applicable, evidence of annual returns filing, registration as a Licensed Customs Agent, joint venture agreement if applicable, charter party agreement if applicable, and a bank reference. The procedure for registration is that the shipping company or its agent submits its application to the General Manager of either the Western or Eastern Ports. Upon submission, a debit note will be received to pay 200,000. After payment confirmation, the Nigerian Port Authority (NPA) issues a receipt. Subsequently, the NPA provides the original Certificate of Registration. The registration license is then issued within two weeks, contingent upon the company providing all required documents as listed  https://nimasa.gov.ng/services/ship-registration/bove. 4. Fulfilment of Tax Obligations: It is important to obtain Tax clearance and a Tax Identification Number (TIN) from the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) before starting operations.

Warehouse Manager’s licenses (Fourth Schedule), c. Certificate of Fumigation\\n\\nThe Micro, Medium & Small enterprises (“MSME”) sector plays a pivotal role in driving socio-economic growth, particularly in emerging economies. In the Nigerian context, the sector’s status as the largest employer of labour makes it an effective supporting sector for fostering entrepreneurial innovation and local capital formation.  In recognizing the role of MSMEs as the engine for economic growth, the Nigerian government established an agency, the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency of Nigeria (“SMEDAN”), with the core task of driving development and growth for the entire sector. Adding to the efforts of SMEDAN, other government agencies also have mandates to deploy interventions funds directed primarily at MSMEs with the objective of activating the sector’s potential as a catalyst for economic growth. A business whether small or big, simple or complex, private or public, etc is created to provide competitive prices. Business in Nigeria has been classified as small, medium and large. However, a small scale industry can be explained by the criteria of project costs, capital, number of employees, sales volume, annual business turnover and the financial strenght. Small scale industry orientation is part and parcel of Nigeria. Evidence abound in our respective communities  of what successes our great grand parents made of their respective trading concerns, yam barns, iron smelting, farming, cottage industries and the likes. So the secret behind their success of a self reliant strategy does not lie in any particular political philosophy, so much as in the people’s attitude to enterprise and if the right incentive is adequate enough to make risk worthy ventures and decisions worth taking. Back home in Nigeria, the respective government policies accorded and gave priority to the country’s small scale enterprises. This has been in recognition that they constitute the fountain head of vitality for the National economy, and consequently their problems have been viewed as those of the nation, by virtue of their number, diversity, penetration in all sectors of production and marketing contribution to employment and to the prosperity of the particular areas in which they operate. In concrete terms, small scale industries constitute a greater percentage of all registered companies in Nigeria, and they have been in existence for a quite long time. Majority of the small scale industries developed from cottage industries to small enterprises and from small scale, to medium and large scale enterprises. Small-scale business, small-scale industries, and small-scale entrepreneurship are often used interchangeably to refer to small-scale industry firms. In Nigeria and globally, there is no universally agreed definition of a small business. Different authors, scholars, and schools of thought define small businesses based on varying factors such as capital outlay, number of employees, sales turnover, fixed capital investment, available plant and machinery, market share, and the level of development. These features also differ from one country to another. SMEs are organizations which can best be described through their capital, scope and cost of projects, annual turnover, financial strength and number of employees amongst other things. Such organizations must and can be registered under any part of the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) in order to do business in Nigeria. Nevertheless, it is usually advised that SMEs register under Part B of the CAMA.  The role of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the development of the Nigerian economy cannot be overemphasized. With over 80% of the Nigerian population employed by MSMEs and contributing about half of the nation’s GDP, the Nigerian economy’s wheels are kept running by MSMEs. MSMEs are not only notorious for their ability to adapt rapidly to market changes, but they are also capable of driving local innovation, making them critical in determining the course of the Nigerian economy. Summarizing the specific contributions of MSMEs to the economy, they have been described as catalysts of “industrial diversification and the expansion of the industrial base, the utilization of local materials and skills, wealth creation and poverty reduction at the grassroots level, employment generation, and consequently the reduction of rural-urban economic migration, among many others.” MSMEs generally refer to businesses with fewer than 200 employees, and they exist both in the formal and the informal sectors in Nigeria. Formal sector MSMEs refer to companies or businesses registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission and legally recognized as business entities while unregistered businesses exist in the informal sector. In Nigeria, like any other civilized society, the role of the law in regulating human activities for the development of the economy is gigantic. Hence, recognizing the magnitude of MSMEs’ stake in the Nigerian economy, laws, and policies have over the years emerged for their regulation, and institutions have been established to facilitate a flourishing business environment for them. However, the effectiveness of these is still in doubt. The Small and Medium-Scale Industries Development Agency was established by the Small and Medium-Scale Industries Development Agency (Establishment) Act. This Act was later amended by the Small and Medium Scale Enterprises Development Agency (Amendment) Act which changed the name of the Agency to the Small and Medium Scale Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDEN). The Act aims to promote and facilitate development programs in the Small and Medium scale enterprises (SMEs) subsectors. SMEDAN has a mandate to facilitate a conducive business environment for MSMEs. Recognizing the peculiar role of MSMEs in the Nigerian economic atmosphere, examining the Agency’s role in these is imperative.  EVOLUTION OF MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE ENTERPRISES IN NIGERIA AS A KEY DRIVER OF THE MODERN ECONOMY Since the industrial revolution of 1798 in Great Britain, the mode and methods of managing businesses and economic activities among countries of the world have experienced tremendous and significant changes which have since contributed to the economic growth of countries around the world. Acknowledging that industrial development requires a radical change of technical arrangement that moves an economy from the traditional approach of production to a multifaceted and sophisticated system capable of bringing about mass production of a variety of goods and services through the use of appropriate technologies and management techniques. This industrial process is capable of propelling economic growth and structural transformation, as it enables full utilization of both human and material resources with little dependence on the external sector for growth and sustenance. The revolution of entrepreneurship in Nigeria in recent times enjoyed the attention of policymakers, researchers and academicians globally. Citizens with small finance, little or no education, and little or no experience can get income via entrepreneurship. Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) businesses are also crucial because they contribute to reducing inequalities by helping with wealth redistribution in the economy. Also, entrepreneurship serves as a means of growth in developing and underdeveloped economies. For a sustainable economy, Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have been highlighted as capable of helping in bringing about a positive economic turnaround and complementing the efforts of the existing medium and large scale industries. The recognition of the importance of the roles of the MSMEs as spark and engine of growth has prompted increased attention and specific education on the method and approach to build and sustain a truly viable private sector dominated by MSMEs. The economic contributions of MSMEs are obvious in the mobilization of idle financial resources, the conservation of foreign exchange, utilization of local raw materials, specialist suppliers to large companies, adding varieties and choice for the consumers, checking the monopolistic tendency power, providing a source or innovation, breeding ground for new industries and above all employment creation by absorbing the larger percentage of the unemployed population in bits. MSMEs formation is necessitated by a couple of drivers as follows: Necessity, Innovation and Opportunity. Necessity-driven entrepreneurs can be as a result of unemployment or just the drive for survival. Opportunity-driven entrepreneurship is typically around a business idea to fill a need or gap, while innovation-driven entrepreneurship is to improve on a process, market, service, or product. To bridge the entrepreneurship gap in Nigeria over time, forward thinking governments in Nigeria to date have initiated one scheme or the other for business opportunities and creation of employment opportunities. The schemes are still subject to further review if the schemes actually fulfil the mandates setting it: Mandatory Credit Guideline in respect of SMEs (1970); Small Scale Industries Credit Guarantee Scheme (1971); Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme (1973); Nigeria Agriculture and Co-operative Bank (1973); Nigerian Bank for Commerce and Industry (1973); Rural Banking Scheme (1977); Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) (1980) The World Bank Assisted SME I (1985) and The World Bank Assisted SME II (1990); Second – Tier Security Market (1985); Peoples Bank (1989); National Economic Reconstruction Fund (1992); Small and Medium Scale Enterprises Loan Scheme (1992); Family Economic Advancement Programme (1997); African Development Bank – Export Stimulation Loan Scheme (ADB-ESL) in 1988; Bank of Industry (BOI) – being merger of NIDB, NBCI and NERFUND) in 2001; Nigerian Agricultural Co-operative and Rural Development Bank (NACRDB) – being merger of NACB, Peoples Bank and Family Economic Advancement Programme (FEAP) in 2002; Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) in 2004; Microfinance banks; Small and Medium Enterprises Credit Guarantee Scheme for SMEs 2010; Real Sector Support Facility (RSSF) 2014; Textile Sector Intervention Fund 2015; etc Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC) 2016 tagged 7th National Action Plan(NAP 7.0). In addition to various government scheme and intervention funds for the sustainability and growth of MSMEs in Nigeria, the advent of Finance Act, 2019 and that of Finance Act, 2020) further amended companies income tax act to create opportunity and enabling business environment to ensure the growth of the sector, section 33, exempted companies that earns gross turnover of less than N25,000,000 in the relevant year of assessment and by interpretation and clarification, companies with gross turnover of N25,000,000 less franked investment income under the Acts  are small and medium companies.\\n\\nThe Micro, Medium & Small enterprises (“MSME”) sector plays a pivotal role in driving socio-economic growth, particularly in emerging economies.

Their function is multifarious, encompassing not only the provision of resources and expertise but also the promotion of receptive policies and the establishment of meeting places for the exchange of ideas. This paper investigates the many ways in which non-governmental organisations (NGOs) assist and promote small enterprises, focusing on their work in the areas of capacity development, policy lobbying, and innovation promotion. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are crucial in bolstering small enterprises’ capabilities. They provide courses and seminars designed to teach company owners how to run their companies efficiently. Financial management, marketing tactics, and company planning are just few of the many subjects often addressed in such courses. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) work to improve the environment for small enterprises via capacity building and policy lobbying. They advocate for laws that safeguard small businesses from unfair competition from larger firms and provide tax breaks and easier access to loans. In addition, NGOs encourage creativity among micro- and small-scale enterprises. They facilitate this by giving business owners a place to network and pick one others’ brains. They also make it easier for small enterprises to have access to cutting-edge tools and fresh approaches to running a company. To sum up, NGOs are crucial in bolstering and developing micro- and small-scale enterprises. They aid small firms greatly by increasing their potential, advocating for better policies, and encouraging creative thinking. However, there is a need for better coordination between NGOs, government agencies, and the commercial sector if their efforts are to be more successful. This will guarantee that the help given to small enterprises is thorough and appropriate. Top 10 Government Agencies that Support SMEs in Nigeria    #1.

The major regulatory objectives of the apex bank are to maintain the external reserves of the country, to promote monetary stability, and to act as a banker of last resort and financial adviser to the federal government.  Nevertheless, the bank had become involved in lending directly to consumers, contravening its original intention to work through commercial banks in activities involving consumer lending. Also, the Nigerian government through the central bank has been actively involved in building the nation’s money and equity centers, forming securities regulatory boards and introducing treasury bills and instruments into the Nigeria capital market.  In addition to its core functions, the Central Bank of Nigeria has over the years performed some major developmental functions; focused on all the key sectors of the Nigerian economy – such as oil and gas, telecommunication, financial, agricultural and industrial sectors.

      "The Micro, Medium & Small enterprises (“MSME”) sector plays a pivotal role in driving socio-economic growth, particularly in emerging economies. In the Nigerian context, the sector’s status as the largest employer of labour makes it an effective supporting sector for fostering entrepreneurial innovation and local capital formation.  In recognizing the role of MSMEs as the engine for economic growth, the Nigerian government established an agency, the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency of Nigeria (“SMEDAN”), with the core task of driving development and growth for the entire sector. Adding to the efforts of SMEDAN, other government agencies also have mandates to deploy interventions funds directed primarily at MSMEs with the objective of activating the sector’s potential as a catalyst for economic growth. A business whether small or big, simple or complex, private or public, etc is created to provide competitive prices. Business in Nigeria has been classified as small, medium and large. However, a small scale industry can be explained by the criteria of project costs, capital, number of employees, sales volume, annual business turnover and the financial strenght. Small scale industry orientation is part and parcel of Nigeria. Evidence abound in our respective communities  of what successes our great grand parents made of their respective trading concerns, yam barns, iron smelting, farming, cottage industries and the likes. So the secret behind their success of a self reliant strategy does not lie in any particular political philosophy, so much as in the people’s attitude to enterprise and if the right incentive is adequate enough to make risk worthy ventures and decisions worth taking. Back home in Nigeria, the respective government policies accorded and gave priority to the country’s small scale enterprises. This has been in recognition that they constitute the fountain head of vitality for the National economy, and consequently their problems have been viewed as those of the nation, by virtue of their number, diversity, penetration in all sectors of production and marketing contribution to employment and to the prosperity of the particular areas in which they operate. In concrete terms, small scale industries constitute a greater percentage of all registered companies in Nigeria, and they have been in existence for a quite long time. Majority of the small scale industries developed from cottage industries to small enterprises and from small scale, to medium and large scale enterprises. Small-scale business, small-scale industries, and small-scale entrepreneurship are often used interchangeably to refer to small-scale industry firms. In Nigeria and globally, there is no universally agreed definition of a small business. Different authors, scholars, and schools of thought define small businesses based on varying factors such as capital outlay, number of employees, sales turnover, fixed capital investment, available plant and machinery, market share, and the level of development. These features also differ from one country to another. SMEs are organizations which can best be described through their capital, scope and cost of projects, annual turnover, financial strength and number of employees amongst other things. Such organizations must and can be registered under any part of the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) in order to do business in Nigeria. Nevertheless, it is usually advised that SMEs register under Part B of the CAMA.  The role of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the development of the Nigerian economy cannot be overemphasized. With over 80% of the Nigerian population employed by MSMEs and contributing about half of the nation’s GDP, the Nigerian economy’s wheels are kept running by MSMEs. MSMEs are not only notorious for their ability to adapt rapidly to market changes, but they are also capable of driving local innovation, making them critical in determining the course of the Nigerian economy. Summarizing the specific contributions of MSMEs to the economy, they have been described as catalysts of “industrial diversification and the expansion of the industrial base, the utilization of local materials and skills, wealth creation and poverty reduction at the grassroots level, employment generation, and consequently the reduction of rural-urban economic migration, among many others.” MSMEs generally refer to businesses with fewer than 200 employees, and they exist both in the formal and the informal sectors in Nigeria. Formal sector MSMEs refer to companies or businesses registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission and legally recognized as business entities while unregistered businesses exist in the informal sector. In Nigeria, like any other civilized society, the role of the law in regulating human activities for the development of the economy is gigantic. Hence, recognizing the magnitude of MSMEs’ stake in the Nigerian economy, laws, and policies have over the years emerged for their regulation, and institutions have been established to facilitate a flourishing business environment for them. However, the effectiveness of these is still in doubt. The Small and Medium-Scale Industries Development Agency was established by the Small and Medium-Scale Industries Development Agency (Establishment) Act. This Act was later amended by the Small and Medium Scale Enterprises Development Agency (Amendment) Act which changed the name of the Agency to the Small and Medium Scale Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDEN). The Act aims to promote and facilitate development programs in the Small and Medium scale enterprises (SMEs) subsectors. SMEDAN has a mandate to facilitate a conducive business environment for MSMEs. Recognizing the peculiar role of MSMEs in the Nigerian economic atmosphere, examining the Agency’s role in these is imperative.  EVOLUTION OF MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE ENTERPRISES IN NIGERIA AS A KEY DRIVER OF THE MODERN ECONOMY Since the industrial revolution of 1798 in Great Britain, the mode and methods of managing businesses and economic activities among countries of the world have experienced tremendous and significant changes which have since contributed to the economic growth of countries around the world. Acknowledging that industrial development requires a radical change of technical arrangement that moves an economy from the traditional approach of production to a multifaceted and sophisticated system capable of bringing about mass production of a variety of goods and services through the use of appropriate technologies and management techniques. This industrial process is capable of propelling economic growth and structural transformation, as it enables full utilization of both human and material resources with little dependence on the external sector for growth and sustenance. The revolution of entrepreneurship in Nigeria in recent times enjoyed the attention of policymakers, researchers and academicians globally. Citizens with small finance, little or no education, and little or no experience can get income via entrepreneurship. Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) businesses are also crucial because they contribute to reducing inequalities by helping with wealth redistribution in the economy. Also, entrepreneurship serves as a means of growth in developing and underdeveloped economies. For a sustainable economy, Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have been highlighted as capable of helping in bringing about a positive economic turnaround and complementing the efforts of the existing medium and large scale industries. The recognition of the importance of the roles of the MSMEs as spark and engine of growth has prompted increased attention and specific education on the method and approach to build and sustain a truly viable private sector dominated by MSMEs. The economic contributions of MSMEs are obvious in the mobilization of idle financial resources, the conservation of foreign exchange, utilization of local raw materials, specialist suppliers to large companies, adding varieties and choice for the consumers, checking the monopolistic tendency power, providing a source or innovation, breeding ground for new industries and above all employment creation by absorbing the larger percentage of the unemployed population in bits. MSMEs formation is necessitated by a couple of drivers as follows: Necessity, Innovation and Opportunity. Necessity-driven entrepreneurs can be as a result of unemployment or just the drive for survival. Opportunity-driven entrepreneurship is typically around a business idea to fill a need or gap, while innovation-driven entrepreneurship is to improve on a process, market, service, or product. To bridge the entrepreneurship gap in Nigeria over time, forward thinking governments in Nigeria to date have initiated one scheme or the other for business opportunities and creation of employment opportunities. The schemes are still subject to further review if the schemes actually fulfil the mandates setting it: Mandatory Credit Guideline in respect of SMEs (1970); Small Scale Industries Credit Guarantee Scheme (1971); Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme (1973); Nigeria Agriculture and Co-operative Bank (1973); Nigerian Bank for Commerce and Industry (1973); Rural Banking Scheme (1977); Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) (1980) The World Bank Assisted SME I (1985) and The World Bank Assisted SME II (1990); Second – Tier Security Market (1985); Peoples Bank (1989); National Economic Reconstruction Fund (1992); Small and Medium Scale Enterprises Loan Scheme (1992); Family Economic Advancement Programme (1997); African Development Bank – Export Stimulation Loan Scheme (ADB-ESL) in 1988; Bank of Industry (BOI) – being merger of NIDB, NBCI and NERFUND) in 2001; Nigerian Agricultural Co-operative and Rural Development Bank (NACRDB) – being merger of NACB, Peoples Bank and Family Economic Advancement Programme (FEAP) in 2002; Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) in 2004; Microfinance banks; Small and Medium Enterprises Credit Guarantee Scheme for SMEs 2010; Real Sector Support Facility (RSSF) 2014; Textile Sector Intervention Fund 2015; etc Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC) 2016 tagged 7th National Action Plan(NAP 7.0). In addition to various government scheme and intervention funds for the sustainability and growth of MSMEs in Nigeria, the advent of Finance Act, 2019 and that of Finance Act, 2020) further amended companies income tax act to create opportunity and enabling business environment to ensure the growth of the sector, section 33, exempted companies that earns gross turnover of less than N25,000,000 in the relevant year of assessment and by interpretation and clarification, companies with gross turnover of N25,000,000 less franked investment income under the Acts  are small and medium companies.\n",

Recognizing the peculiar role of MSMEs in the Nigerian economic atmosphere, examining the Agency’s role in these is imperative.  EVOLUTION OF MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE ENTERPRISES IN NIGERIA AS A KEY DRIVER OF THE MODERN ECONOMY Since the industrial revolution of 1798 in Great Britain, the mode and methods of managing businesses and economic activities among countries of the world have experienced tremendous and significant changes which have since contributed to the economic growth of countries around the world. Acknowledging that industrial development requires a radical change of technical arrangement that moves an economy from the traditional approach of production to a multifaceted and sophisticated system capable of bringing about mass production of a variety of goods and services through the use of appropriate technologies and management techniques. This industrial process is capable of propelling economic growth and structural transformation, as it enables full utilization of both human and material resources with little dependence on the external sector for growth and sustenance. The revolution of entrepreneurship in Nigeria in recent times enjoyed the attention of policymakers, researchers and academicians globally. Citizens with small finance, little or no education, and little or no experience can get income via entrepreneurship. Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) businesses are also crucial because they contribute to reducing inequalities by helping with wealth redistribution in the economy. Also, entrepreneurship serves as a means of growth in developing and underdeveloped economies. For a sustainable economy, Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have been highlighted as capable of helping in bringing about a positive economic turnaround and complementing the efforts of the existing medium and large scale industries. The recognition of the importance of the roles of the MSMEs as spark and engine of growth has prompted increased attention and specific education on the method and approach to build and sustain a truly viable private sector dominated by MSMEs. The economic contributions of MSMEs are obvious in the mobilization of idle financial resources, the conservation of foreign exchange, utilization of local raw materials, specialist suppliers to large companies, adding varieties and choice for the consumers, checking the monopolistic tendency power, providing a source or innovation, breeding ground for new industries and above all employment creation by absorbing the larger percentage of the unemployed population in bits. MSMEs formation is necessitated by a couple of drivers as follows: Necessity, Innovation and Opportunity. Necessity-driven entrepreneurs can be as a result of unemployment or just the drive for survival. Opportunity-driven entrepreneurship is typically around a business idea to fill a need or gap, while innovation-driven entrepreneurship is to improve on a process, market, service, or product. To bridge the entrepreneurship gap in Nigeria over time, forward thinking governments in Nigeria to date have initiated one scheme or the other for business opportunities and creation of employment opportunities. The schemes are still subject to further review if the schemes actually fulfil the mandates setting it: Mandatory Credit Guideline in respect of SMEs (1970); Small Scale Industries Credit Guarantee Scheme (1971); Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme (1973); Nigeria Agriculture and Co-operative Bank (1973); Nigerian Bank for Commerce and Industry (1973); Rural Banking Scheme (1977); Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) (1980) The World Bank Assisted SME I (1985) and The World Bank Assisted SME II (1990); Second – Tier Security Market (1985); Peoples Bank (1989); National Economic Reconstruction Fund (1992); Small and Medium Scale Enterprises Loan Scheme (1992); Family Economic Advancement Programme (1997); African Development Bank – Export Stimulation Loan Scheme (ADB-ESL) in 1988; Bank of Industry (BOI) – being merger of NIDB, NBCI and NERFUND) in 2001; Nigerian Agricultural Co-operative and Rural Development Bank (NACRDB) – being merger of NACB, Peoples Bank and Family Economic Advancement Programme (FEAP) in 2002; Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) in 2004; Microfinance banks; Small and Medium Enterprises Credit Guarantee Scheme for SMEs 2010; Real Sector Support Facility (RSSF) 2014; Textile Sector Intervention Fund 2015; etc Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC) 2016 tagged 7th National Action Plan(NAP 7.0). In addition to various government scheme and intervention funds for the sustainability and growth of MSMEs in Nigeria, the advent of Finance Act, 2019 and that of Finance Act, 2020) further amended companies income tax act to create opportunity and enabling business environment to ensure the growth of the sector, section 33, exempted companies that earns gross turnover of less than N25,000,000 in the relevant year of assessment and by interpretation and clarification, companies with gross turnover of N25,000,000 less franked investment income under the Acts  are small and medium companies.\n",

      "The Micro, Medium & Small enterprises (“MSME”) sector plays a pivotal role in driving socio-economic growth, particularly in emerging economies. In the Nigerian context, the sector’s status as the largest employer of labour makes it an effective supporting sector for fostering entrepreneurial innovation and local capital formation.  In recognizing the role of MSMEs as the engine for economic growth, the Nigerian government established an agency, the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency of Nigeria (“SMEDAN”), with the core task of driving development and growth for the entire sector. Adding to the efforts of SMEDAN, other government agencies also have mandates to deploy interventions funds directed primarily at MSMEs with the objective of activating the sector’s potential as a catalyst for economic growth. A business whether small or big, simple or complex, private or public, etc is created to provide competitive prices. Business in Nigeria has been classified as small, medium and large. However, a small scale industry can be explained by the criteria of project costs, capital, number of employees, sales volume, annual business turnover and the financial strenght. Small scale industry orientation is part and parcel of Nigeria. Evidence abound in our respective communities  of what successes our great grand parents made of their respective trading concerns, yam barns, iron smelting, farming, cottage industries and the likes. So the secret behind their success of a self reliant strategy does not lie in any particular political philosophy, so much as in the people’s attitude to enterprise and if the right incentive is adequate enough to make risk worthy ventures and decisions worth taking. Back home in Nigeria, the respective government policies accorded and gave priority to the country’s small scale enterprises. This has been in recognition that they constitute the fountain head of vitality for the National economy, and consequently their problems have been viewed as those of the nation, by virtue of their number, diversity, penetration in all sectors of production and marketing contribution to employment and to the prosperity of the particular areas in which they operate. In concrete terms, small scale industries constitute a greater percentage of all registered companies in Nigeria, and they have been in existence for a quite long time. Majority of the small scale industries developed from cottage industries to small enterprises and from small scale, to medium and large scale enterprises. Small-scale business, small-scale industries, and small-scale entrepreneurship are often used interchangeably to refer to small-scale industry firms. In Nigeria and globally, there is no universally agreed definition of a small business. Different authors, scholars, and schools of thought define small businesses based on varying factors such as capital outlay, number of employees, sales turnover, fixed capital investment, available plant and machinery, market share, and the level of development. These features also differ from one country to another. SMEs are organizations which can best be described through their capital, scope and cost of projects, annual turnover, financial strength and number of employees amongst other things. Such organizations must and can be registered under any part of the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) in order to do business in Nigeria. Nevertheless, it is usually advised that SMEs register under Part B of the CAMA.  The role of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the development of the Nigerian economy cannot be overemphasized. With over 80% of the Nigerian population employed by MSMEs and contributing about half of the nation’s GDP, the Nigerian economy’s wheels are kept running by MSMEs. MSMEs are not only notorious for their ability to adapt rapidly to market changes, but they are also capable of driving local innovation, making them critical in determining the course of the Nigerian economy. Summarizing the specific contributions of MSMEs to the economy, they have been described as catalysts of “industrial diversification and the expansion of the industrial base, the utilization of local materials and skills, wealth creation and poverty reduction at the grassroots level, employment generation, and consequently the reduction of rural-urban economic migration, among many others.” MSMEs generally refer to businesses with fewer than 200 employees, and they exist both in the formal and the informal sectors in Nigeria. Formal sector MSMEs refer to companies or businesses registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission and legally recognized as business entities while unregistered businesses exist in the informal sector. In Nigeria, like any other civilized society, the role of the law in regulating human activities for the development of the economy is gigantic. Hence, recognizing the magnitude of MSMEs’ stake in the Nigerian economy, laws, and policies have over the years emerged for their regulation, and institutions have been established to facilitate a flourishing business environment for them. However, the effectiveness of these is still in doubt. The Small and Medium-Scale Industries Development Agency was established by the Small and Medium-Scale Industries Development Agency (Establishment) Act. This Act was later amended by the Small and Medium Scale Enterprises Development Agency (Amendment) Act which changed the name of the Agency to the Small and Medium Scale Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDEN). The Act aims to promote and facilitate development programs in the Small and Medium scale enterprises (SMEs) subsectors. SMEDAN has a mandate to facilitate a conducive business environment for MSMEs.
