Definition and Importance of MSMEs**    - Definitions according to Nigerian policies (e.g., SMEDAN criteria).    - Role of MSMEs in Nigeria's economy (employment, GDP contribution, innovation). DEFINITION OF MSMEs IN NIGERIA  From the point of view of national policy, enterprises may be classified by size, sector, organisation, staff strength, technology and location. These variables interact with each other in complex ways which must be taken into cognisance to understand the nature, characteristics, performance, problems and challenges of business enterprises. From the perspective of policy and planning, size provides the most practical basis for classification.  The usual criteria include one or more of the following: employment, turnover, assets, and paid-up capital. However, definitions vary from country to country relative to the overall size and structure of the domestic economy. For the purpose of a coherent national policy, it is necessary to establish a standard definition in order to provide a common object of reference by stakeholders. Based on the assessment of existing national perspectives on the classification of MSMEs, the National Policy on MSMEs adopts a classification based on dual criteria: employment and assets (excluding land and buildings), as follows: Classification adopted by the National Policy on MSMEs: Micro enterprises have an employee size of less than 10 and assets (excluding land and buildings) of less than 10 million naira. Small enterprises have an employee size of 10-49 and assets (excluding land and buildings) of over 10 million naira but less than 100 million naira. Medium enterprises have an employee size of 50-199 and assets (excluding land and buildings) worth more than 100 million naira but less than 1 billion naira.  Where there exists a conflict in classification between employment and assets criteria (for example, if an enterprise has assets worth twelve million naira (N12m) but employs 7 persons), the employment-based classification will take precedence and the enterprise would be regarded as micro. Employment-based classification tends to provide a relatively more stable definition, given that inflationary trends frequently compromise the asset-based definition. In choosing these new definitions, cognisance was taken of all possible factors, including international comparisons and peculiarities of the various sub-sectors/enterprises. MSME definition by: SMEDAN Micro Enterprise: Employees <10, Asset Base <N5 Million Small Enterprise: Employees >10 but <50, Asset Base >N5 but <50 Million Medium Enterprise: Employees >50 but <200, Asset Base >N50 but <500 Million  BoI Micro Enterprise: Employees 1 to 10; Turnover <N20 Million; Asset Base <N5 Million Small Enterprise: Employees >11 to 50; Turnover >N20 to <N100 Million; Asset Base >N5 to N50 Million Medium Enterprise: Employees >51 to 200; Turnover >N100 to <N500 Million; Asset Base: >N50 to N500 Million  CBN Micro Enterprise: *Employees <11; Asset Base <N5 Million Small Enterprise: Employees 11 to 300; Asset Base N5 to <500 Million Medium Enterprise: Employees 11 to 300; Asset Base N5 to <500 Million  Based on the various definitions above, MSMEs are broadly defined as enterprises with a labour force between 1-300 people, annual turnover less than N500 million and an asset base no more than N500 million.  CHARACTERISTICS AND PERFORMANCE OF MSMEs IN NIGERIA  MSMEs cover the entire range of economic activity sectors in Nigeria. There are a number of challenges that currently stifle MSMEs in the country and some of these challenges are consistent across the varying types of MSMEs. These include low market access, poor access to credit, poor information flow, discriminatory legislation, poor access to land, weak linkage among different segments of the operations in the sector, weak operating capacities in terms of skills, technology, knowledge and attitudes, as well as lack of infrastructure. There are also weak safeguards against occupational health and environmental hazards.  However, each of the three categories of MSMEs has its own peculiar characteristics and problems, requiring targeted policies to address them.  Micro Enterprises  Micro Enterprises employ between 1 and 9 persons. The 2013 National MSME collaborative survey put the estimated number of micro enterprises at 36.99 million with a minimum total employment of 57.84 million. This group is dominated by those who engage in wholesale & retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and household goods which accounts for about 54.67% followed by manufacturing (13.21%). Other numerically significant sectors include agriculture (8.92%), other services (7.80%), accommodation and food services (5.51%), transport & storage (4.76%) and arts, entertainment & recreation (1.06%).  The typical micro enterprise is operated by a sole proprietor/manager aided mainly by unpaid family workers and the occasional paid employee and apprentice. Output value is very low. The levels of technology and skills are also very low. However, with the entry of many unemployed school leavers, including secondary school leavers and graduate of tertiary institutions, there is much scope for upgrading technology and skills set for existing enterprises and for the rise of new technology-based enterprises. Funding is mainly from individual resources, with a little help from family and traditional mutual fund societies (esusu). Government interacts very little with individual micro enterprises, except through the occasional cooperative or other officially recognised groups. According to the Enterprise Baseline Survey 2012 (EBS) conducted by GIZ and SMEDAN, the propensity of formal micro enterprises to invest is 88% compared with only 16% of informal micro businesses. Bank loans are rarely sought and very rarely obtained. Micro enterprises have two strong points in their favour. They are numerous and ubiquitous and grow in numbers but have little propensity to grow internally and further develop their business. Even a small improvement in their productivity and output would result in large improvements in employment, income and productivity in every nook and corner of the country, but dealing with them requires sensitivity, empathy and a community-focused approach.  Small Enterprises  Small enterprises (with employment from 10 - 49 persons) cover much the same spectrum of enterprise types but are concentrated in the more modern, more sophisticated end. The 2013 National MSMEs Survey put the number of small enterprises in Nigeria at 68,168. While most of them are sole proprietorships, a significant number are incorporated businesses. This segment has a large reservoir of educated manpower and technical skills, as well as relatively improved access to the banks. They employ approximately 1.86 million people according to the 2013 collaborative survey. According to the EBS 2012, 89% of formal small enterprises plan to invest whereas only 19% of informal small businesses plan to invest. It has the highest potential for growth through nurturing, capacity building and support. Organisationally, they are well represented by professional and trade associations. Medium Enterprises  Medium enterprises are the formal face of Nigerian enterprises employing between 50 and 199 persons. The 2013 National MSMEs Survey put the number of medium enterprises in Nigeria at 4,670. Concentrated in a few sectors, notably manufacturing, transportation, information and communication technology, agro & agro-allied and oil & gas, they are fairly well organised and well connected. They have fairly good access to government and the financial system. Few in number and restricted in scope, they represent the popular Missing Middle"" of Nigeria's private enterprise system."""
"**Understanding MSMEs in Nigeria** 1. **Overview of the MSME Sector**    - Statistical data (number of MSMEs, sectoral distribution, urban vs. rural).    - Key industries and opportunities.","https://www.mondaq.com/nigeria/directors-and-officers/757432/small-and-medium-scale-enterprises-in-nigeria-an-overview-of-initial-set-up, https://globaljournals.org/GJMBR_Volume13/1-Small-and-Medium-Scale-Enterprises.pdf, https://www.pdfnigeria.org/rc/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/33_PDFII_Report_Strategic_Recommendation_MSME.pdf , https://omaplex.com.ng/improving-the-nigerian-economy-through-msmes/#google_vignette, https://portal.citn.org/evolution-of-micro-small-and-medium-scale-enterprises-in-nigeria-as-a-key-driver-of-the-modern-economy/blog/","The Micro, Medium & Small enterprises (“MSME”) sector plays a pivotal role in driving socio-economic growth, particularly in emerging economies. In the Nigerian context, the sector’s status as the largest employer of labour makes it an effective supporting sector for fostering entrepreneurial innovation and local capital formation.  In recognizing the role of MSMEs as the engine for economic growth, the Nigerian government established an agency, the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency of Nigeria (“SMEDAN”), with the core task of driving development and growth for the entire sector. Adding to the efforts of SMEDAN, other government agencies also have mandates to deploy interventions funds directed primarily at MSMEs with the objective of activating the sector’s potential as a catalyst for economic growth. A business whether small or big, simple or complex, private or public, etc is created to provide competitive prices. Business in Nigeria has been classified as small, medium and large. However, a small scale industry can be explained by the criteria of project costs, capital, number of employees, sales volume, annual business turnover and the financial strenght. Small scale industry orientation is part and parcel of Nigeria. Evidence abound in our respective communities  of what successes our great grand parents made of their respective trading concerns, yam barns, iron smelting, farming, cottage industries and the likes. So the secret behind their success of a self reliant strategy does not lie in any particular political philosophy, so much as in the people’s attitude to enterprise and if the right incentive is adequate enough to make risk worthy ventures and decisions worth taking. Back home in Nigeria, the respective government policies accorded and gave priority to the country’s small scale enterprises. This has been in recognition that they constitute the fountain head of vitality for the National economy, and consequently their problems have been viewed as those of the nation, by virtue of their number, diversity, penetration in all sectors of production and marketing contribution to employment and to the prosperity of the particular areas in which they operate. In concrete terms, small scale industries constitute a greater percentage of all registered companies in Nigeria, and they have been in existence for a quite long time. Majority of the small scale industries developed from cottage industries to small enterprises and from small scale, to medium and large scale enterprises. Small-scale business, small-scale industries, and small-scale entrepreneurship are often used interchangeably to refer to small-scale industry firms. In Nigeria and globally, there is no universally agreed definition of a small business. Different authors, scholars, and schools of thought define small businesses based on varying factors such as capital outlay, number of employees, sales turnover, fixed capital investment, available plant and machinery, market share, and the level of development. These features also differ from one country to another. SMEs are organizations which can best be described through their capital, scope and cost of projects, annual turnover, financial strength and number of employees amongst other things. Such organizations must and can be registered under any part of the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) in order to do business in Nigeria. Nevertheless, it is usually advised that SMEs register under Part B of the CAMA.  The role of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the development of the Nigerian economy cannot be overemphasized. With over 80% of the Nigerian population employed by MSMEs and contributing about half of the nation’s GDP, the Nigerian economy’s wheels are kept running by MSMEs. MSMEs are not only notorious for their ability to adapt rapidly to market changes, but they are also capable of driving local innovation, making them critical in determining the course of the Nigerian economy. Summarizing the specific contributions of MSMEs to the economy, they have been described as catalysts of “industrial diversification and the expansion of the industrial base, the utilization of local materials and skills, wealth creation and poverty reduction at the grassroots level, employment generation, and consequently the reduction of rural-urban economic migration, among many others.” MSMEs generally refer to businesses with fewer than 200 employees, and they exist both in the formal and the informal sectors in Nigeria. Formal sector MSMEs refer to companies or businesses registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission and legally recognized as business entities while unregistered businesses exist in the informal sector. In Nigeria, like any other civilized society, the role of the law in regulating human activities for the development of the economy is gigantic. Hence, recognizing the magnitude of MSMEs’ stake in the Nigerian economy, laws, and policies have over the years emerged for their regulation, and institutions have been established to facilitate a flourishing business environment for them. However, the effectiveness of these is still in doubt. The Small and Medium-Scale Industries Development Agency was established by the Small and Medium-Scale Industries Development Agency (Establishment) Act. This Act was later amended by the Small and Medium Scale Enterprises Development Agency (Amendment) Act which changed the name of the Agency to the Small and Medium Scale Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDEN). The Act aims to promote and facilitate development programs in the Small and Medium scale enterprises (SMEs) subsectors. SMEDAN has a mandate to facilitate a conducive business environment for MSMEs. Recognizing the peculiar role of MSMEs in the Nigerian economic atmosphere, examining the Agency’s role in these is imperative.  EVOLUTION OF MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE ENTERPRISES IN NIGERIA AS A KEY DRIVER OF THE MODERN ECONOMY Since the industrial revolution of 1798 in Great Britain, the mode and methods of managing businesses and economic activities among countries of the world have experienced tremendous and significant changes which have since contributed to the economic growth of countries around the world. Acknowledging that industrial development requires a radical change of technical arrangement that moves an economy from the traditional approach of production to a multifaceted and sophisticated system capable of bringing about mass production of a variety of goods and services through the use of appropriate technologies and management techniques. This industrial process is capable of propelling economic growth and structural transformation, as it enables full utilization of both human and material resources with little dependence on the external sector for growth and sustenance. The revolution of entrepreneurship in Nigeria in recent times enjoyed the attention of policymakers, researchers and academicians globally. Citizens with small finance, little or no education, and little or no experience can get income via entrepreneurship. Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) businesses are also crucial because they contribute to reducing inequalities by helping with wealth redistribution in the economy. Also, entrepreneurship serves as a means of growth in developing and underdeveloped economies. For a sustainable economy, Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have been highlighted as capable of helping in bringing about a positive economic turnaround and complementing the efforts of the existing medium and large scale industries. The recognition of the importance of the roles of the MSMEs as spark and engine of growth has prompted increased attention and specific education on the method and approach to build and sustain a truly viable private sector dominated by MSMEs. The economic contributions of MSMEs are obvious in the mobilization of idle financial resources, the conservation of foreign exchange, utilization of local raw materials, specialist suppliers to large companies, adding varieties and choice for the consumers, checking the monopolistic tendency power, providing a source or innovation, breeding ground for new industries and above all employment creation by absorbing the larger percentage of the unemployed population in bits. MSMEs formation is necessitated by a couple of drivers as follows: Necessity, Innovation and Opportunity. Necessity-driven entrepreneurs can be as a result of unemployment or just the drive for survival. Opportunity-driven entrepreneurship is typically around a business idea to fill a need or gap, while innovation-driven entrepreneurship is to improve on a process, market, service, or product. To bridge the entrepreneurship gap in Nigeria over time, forward thinking governments in Nigeria to date have initiated one scheme or the other for business opportunities and creation of employment opportunities. The schemes are still subject to further review if the schemes actually fulfil the mandates setting it: Mandatory Credit Guideline in respect of SMEs (1970); Small Scale Industries Credit Guarantee Scheme (1971); Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme (1973); Nigeria Agriculture and Co-operative Bank (1973); Nigerian Bank for Commerce and Industry (1973); Rural Banking Scheme (1977); Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) (1980) The World Bank Assisted SME I (1985) and The World Bank Assisted SME II (1990); Second – Tier Security Market (1985); Peoples Bank (1989); National Economic Reconstruction Fund (1992); Small and Medium Scale Enterprises Loan Scheme (1992); Family Economic Advancement Programme (1997); African Development Bank – Export Stimulation Loan Scheme (ADB-ESL) in 1988; Bank of Industry (BOI) – being merger of NIDB, NBCI and NERFUND) in 2001; Nigerian Agricultural Co-operative and Rural Development Bank (NACRDB) – being merger of NACB, Peoples Bank and Family Economic Advancement Programme (FEAP) in 2002; Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) in 2004; Microfinance banks; Small and Medium Enterprises Credit Guarantee Scheme for SMEs 2010; Real Sector Support Facility (RSSF) 2014; Textile Sector Intervention Fund 2015; etc Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC) 2016 tagged 7th National Action Plan(NAP 7.0). In addition to various government scheme and intervention funds for the sustainability and growth of MSMEs in Nigeria, the advent of Finance Act, 2019 and that of Finance Act, 2020) further amended companies income tax act to create opportunity and enabling business environment to ensure the growth of the sector, section 33, exempted companies that earns gross turnover of less than N25,000,000 in the relevant year of assessment and by interpretation and clarification, companies with gross turnover of N25,000,000 less franked investment income under the Acts  are small and medium companies."

It is on this premise that several efforts are geared towards consciously providing the enabling environment for the MSMEs to thrive. This sub-sector needs special attention by the Government because the operatives are largely informal and financially very weak and at the same time they need to develop for the national economy to grow. The EBS 2012 shows that significant differences exist between formal enterprises and informal businesses in the areas of higher average staffing and a higher growth of staffing since business establishment. As in many developing countries, MSMEs in Nigeria have not achieved their full potential as a result of some critical inhibiting factors. These factors, which can be classified into internal and external, include among others:  Internal factors 1. Aversion to joint ownership 2. Family ties, i.e. bringing family into business. 3. Financial mismanagement 4. Lack of basic business capacity (knowledge, skills & attitude) 5. Non-recruitment of qualified personnel 6. Lack of perseverance and staying power when the business is going through tough times. 7. Poor record keeping especially accounting books 8. Lack of standardization of products 9. Being the all-in-all, i.e. managing director, accountant, cashier, admin. Manager, etc. 10. Low capacity to invest in R&D, ICT & E-commerce   11. Inadequate linkage to local & international supply chains 12. Limited access to markets. 13. Lack of exit/succession plan. 14. Declining business etiquette & disregard for contract sanctities.   External factors 1. Poor state of infrastructure 2. Weak access to production inputs (such as finance, workspace) & product markets etc. 3. Multiplicity of Taxes and levies plus red tape 4. Low access to information 5. Unfair competition with dumped products substitutes.  Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) play a crucial role in Nigeria’s economy, driving innovation, job creation, and economic growth. However, these SMEs face numerous challenges that hinder their progress and sustainability. We will explore the key challenges faced by SMEs in Nigeria today and provide practical solutions to help overcome them. 1. Limited Access to Finance Access to affordable finance remains a significant hurdle for SMEs in Nigeria. High-interest rates, stringent collateral requirements, and limited credit history make it difficult for these businesses to secure the funds they need to grow and expand.  2. Infrastructure Development Inadequate infrastructure, including unstable power supply, poor road networks, and limited technology access, hampers the productivity and efficiency of SMEs, leading to increased costs and operational challenges.  3. Limited Market Access and Competition SMEs often struggle to penetrate existing markets due to fierce competition from larger firms and a lack of market information. They need help accessing export markets and expanding beyond their local boundaries. 4. Inadequate Skills and Capacity The unavailability of skilled labor, including technical expertise, management capabilities, and entrepreneurial skills, poses a significant challenge for SMEs in Nigeria. The lack of a skilled workforce can hamper growth and innovation.  5. Regulatory and Administrative Burdens Complex regulatory frameworks, excessive bureaucracy, and corruption create barriers for SMEs in Nigeria. Cumbersome business registration processes, obtaining permits, and complying with tax regulations add to the administrative burden faced by SMEs.  ISSUES AND CHALLENGES It is undeniable that MSMEs are critical to employment generation and economic growth in Nigeria. The Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) has consistently strived to fulfill its responsibilities as outlined in the relevant legislation through cooperative efforts and partnerships. Nevertheless, various obstacles continue to impede its endeavors. Primarily, a thorough examination of the governing legislation elucidates that the primary purpose is to foster the promotion and growth of MSMEs, without extending to regulatory or supervisory functions. This presents a significant challenge, particularly considering the coexistence of MSMEs within both formal and informal sectors of the economy. What is more appalling is the growing number of businesses in the informal sector despite continuous efforts by the CAC as well as other stakeholders to ensure that businesses get registered in the country. The fact then remains that MSMEs in the informal sector are without any form of control or regulation, and this can have a ripple effect on the economy. An unregulated business environment results in stunted economic growth, lower standards, and ultimately market failure. At the same time, while SMEDAN’s mandate encompasses MSMEs broadly, its lack of regulatory authority leaves a substantial segment of the economy unregulated by statutory frameworks. Furthermore, an assessment of the operations of MSMEs and their attendant challenges in the Nigerian clime is critical evidence of the effectiveness of SMEDAN. Despite the agency’s developmental efforts over the years, MSMEs continue to face challenges such as insufficient entrepreneurial experience, poor funding, and under-capitalization, inadequate infrastructural facilities, poor record keeping by small business owners/managers, insecurity in parts of the country, inadequate credit control/loan default, poor time management, high investment in luxury assets, poor macro-economic conditions. These invariable casts a shadow on the effectiveness of the Agency’s training and developmental activities. Another impediment is the limited awareness of SMEDAN’s activities within the formal and informal sectors. As a result of this, only a fraction of MSMEs have access to the benefits offered by the Agency and this defeats the purpose of its establishment. If the Nigerian economy is to witness a radical reform through MSMEs then the Agency’s activities and services need to be more pronounced among them. Moreover, bureaucratic obstacles often prevent MSMEs from using SMEDAN’s support services. This is due to red-tapism, protracted and onerous administrative processes, and prolonged application processing times which can deter them from requesting support from the organization.  Empowering Nigeria’s Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs): Overcoming Challenges for Economic Prosperity Over time, Nigeria’s economy has significantly relied upon the oil and agricultural sectors as its primary pillars of growth and development. However, a notable paradigm shift has been observed as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have emerged as pivotal drivers of economic expansion within the country. These SMEs are critical in Nigeria’s economic landscape, contributing substantially to employment generation and gross domestic product (GDP).   According to the Nigerian Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency (SMEDAN), SMEs in Nigeria account for more than 50% of industrial employment and contribute approximately 48% to the country’s GDP. This remarkable contribution has not only propelled economic growth but has also garnered international recognition, showcasing the immense potential of Nigeria’s SME sector in fostering progress and advancement.   The contributions of SMEs encompass a wide array of aspects, including but not limited to job creation, economic diversification, local economic development, innovation, entrepreneurship, and poverty eradication. Despite their significant contributions, SMEs in Nigeria face a myriad of challenges, collectively referred to as the “Nigerian Factor.”   The term “Nigerian Factor” refers to the challenges and hindrances within Nigeria’s business environment that can impede the expansion and success of small and medium-sized enterprises. This article explores these challenges and discusses potential solutions to empower SMEs and cultivate a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem in Nigeria. The Challenges:   Limited Access to Financing: One of the predominant hurdles faced by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria revolves around the challenge of accessing viable financing options. According to the World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys for Nigeria, access to finance consistently emerges as a paramount business constraint. In the 2019 survey, 48% of Nigerian firms identified access to finance as a significant constraint, underscoring the pervasive nature of this issue. Despite numerous financial institutions in the country, SMEs often find themselves compelled to self-fund for various compelling reasons. These encompass onerous collateral prerequisites, excessively high interest rates, and the absence of an established credit history, impeding their capacity to secure loans.   To confront this pressing challenge, it is imperative that innovative financing avenues, such as Venture capital funds, angel investors, and microfinance organisations, furnish SMEs with specialised financial solutions tailored to their unique requirements. These alternatives offer the necessary support and flexibility that conventional lenders cannot provide, especially for SMEs with high-growth potential.   Furthermore, the government can play a pivotal role in redressing this issue by instating financial initiatives to furnish SMEs with favourable loan terms. Such initiatives empower SMEs to access the required funds more advantageously, enabling them to expand and prosper. Additionally, bolstering financial literacy among SME proprietors and entrepreneurs can substantially contribute to their proficiency in navigating the intricate financing terrain, comprehending loan conditions, and effectively managing their credit. This can be achieved through targeted training programs and workshops.   Inadequate Infrastructure: Nigeria faces significant infrastructure hurdles, including recurrent power interruptions, inadequate transportation systems, and limited access to reliable internet services. The World Bank’s annual Doing Business report consistently underscores these challenges. In the 2021 report, Nigeria ranked 171st out of 190 countries in the “Getting Electricity” category, indicating significant difficulties in securing dependable power. These obstacles place considerable financial burdens on businesses and hinder the smooth operations of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), constraining their long-term growth potential.   To tackle these issues, the government must prioritise infrastructure development, especially in areas densely populated with SMEs. This entails substantial investments in power generation and distribution systems to mitigate frequent outages, collaborating with a telecommunications company to expand broadband infrastructure for enhanced nationwide internet connectivity, and facilitating the effective use of digital tools and platforms for business operations, communication, and online market access. Additionally, enhancing transportation networks, encompassing roads, ports, and logistics infrastructure, will bolster connectivity and reduce transportation expenses for SMEs.   The government can also create a supportive environment conducive to SME growth by leveraging the potential of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure projects. This approach will alleviate the strain on public finances, ensuring efficient project implementation. Consequently, it will attract investments, foster entrepreneurial ventures, and stimulate economic growth, benefiting SMEs and the broader economy.   Exchange Rate Volatility: Nigeria’s recent adoption of rate unification or floating rate policies has substantially impacted small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), especially considering the country’s dependence on imports. The consequences of this policy on businesses will be contingent on various factors. However, the volatility in exchange rates can pose challenges for SMEs in terms of planning, budgeting, and handling their exposure to foreign exchange.   Research from the International Journal of Economics, Commerce, and Management (IJECM) underscores the significance of government involvement in aiding SMEs in dealing with currency risks. Providing access to hedging tools and implementing financial education programs can bolster SMEs’ capacity to withstand fluctuations in exchange rates (Reference: IJECM, Vol. 7, No. 2, February 2019).   SMEs can employ risk management techniques like hedging to mitigate potential currency risks. Hedging involves using financial instruments or methods to protect against unfavourable shifts in exchange rates. By implementing hedging strategies, SMEs can proficiently handle their exposure to currency fluctuations and decrease the potential adverse impact on their operations. Additionally, SMEs should closely monitor exchange rate dynamics, stay well-informed about market conditions, and seek expert guidance to determine the most suitable risk management strategies for their specific circumstances. This approach will enable them to make well-informed decisions regarding their exposure to foreign exchange.   Lack of Technological Adoption: A study by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in Nigeria indicated that a significant portion of SMEs in the country still operate with minimal or no technological integration in their business processes. This study highlighted that only a small percentage of SMEs had adopted modern technologies.   In Nigeria, adopting contemporary technology is paramount for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to enhance their competitiveness in the global market and achieve scalability.   However, many SMEs in the country still rely on outdated practices, significantly limiting their growth potential. To effectively address this issue and foster a conducive environment for technological advancement, the government must implement comprehensive measures that support the development of digital infrastructure and encourage SMEs to embrace technology, which can be done by providing robust training programs tailored to their specific needs. The World Bank, in its report on global competitiveness, has emphasised the crucial role of technology adoption for SMEs to stay competitive and thrive in today’s rapidly evolving business landscape.   These programs should offer comprehensive training and capacity-building initiatives to equip SME owners and employees with the necessary skills and knowledge to leverage contemporary technologies effectively. By enhancing their digital literacy and technical expertise, SMEs can overcome barriers and confidently embrace innovative tools and practices.   Inadequate Business Support Services: To effectively address the challenge of insufficient business support services for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), it is highly recommended that the government establish a supportive ecosystem. This can be achieved by establishing business development centres and incubation hubs nationwide. These centres would serve as knowledge hubs, providing SMEs with vital resources, mentoring, training programs, and access to market data. Furthermore, establishing such centres is intended to foster the growth, sustainability, and overall success of SMEs in the country.   Policy Inconsistencies and Regulatory Burdens: Policy inconsistencies and regulatory burdens for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria have been longstanding challenges that hinder the growth and development of this crucial sector. Here are some of the key aspects contributing to the problem:   – Frequent Policy Changes: SMEs in Nigeria often face challenges due to the frequent changes in policies and regulations. These sudden and unpredictable changes make it difficult for businesses to plan and invest long-term.   – Lack of Coordination: There is often a lack of coordination and coherence among various government agencies responsible for regulating SMEs. This leads to confusion and inefficiencies in compliance, as businesses may receive conflicting information from different sources.   – Complex Registration and Licensing Procedures: Registering and obtaining licenses for SMEs can be complex and time-consuming. This can discourage potential entrepreneurs and lead to a significant portion of the informal economy.   – Taxation and Multiple Levies: SMEs often face challenges related to taxation. There are multiple levels of taxation, including federal, state, and local government levies. The complexity and sometimes arbitrary nature of these taxes can significantly burden SMEs.   – Inconsistent Enforcement of Regulations: Even when regulations exist, enforcement can be inconsistent. This can lead to unfair competition and a lack of a level playing field for SMEs.   A comprehensive analysis conducted by the World Bank Group under the title “Doing Business 2020: Comparing Business Regulation in 190 Economies” underscores the profound impact of regulatory conditions on SMEs. It highlights the critical necessity of streamlining administrative procedures and simplifying regulatory frameworks to promote and support business development.   To promote the growth of SMEs, it is essential to streamline administrative processes, simplify regulatory frameworks, and establish policy consistency. By undertaking these measures, a more favourable business environment can be created, fostering the development and success of SMEs.   Corruption: Nigeria grapples with persistent corruption issues, with far-reaching consequences for its small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The World Bank conducts rigorous Enterprise Surveys to evaluate the business landscape across different nations, Nigeria included. These assessments consistently spotlight corruption-related hurdles SMEs encounter, such as irregular payments and bribery. Corruption takes on various forms, including bribery and extortion, creating significant barriers for SMEs when navigating official procedures, obtaining necessary permits, and accessing crucial resources. Furthermore, corruption erodes trust and confidence in the commercial sphere, making it increasingly challenging for SMEs to secure investments and establish valuable partnerships. Effectively tackling corruption is crucial for establishing a just and transparent business environment that nurtures the growth and prosperity of SMEs in Nigeria.   In summary, by empowering Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria and strategically resolving pertinent challenges, the nation stands poised to unleash the untapped potential within its SME sector. This, in turn, will catalyse a sustained surge in economic growth and overall development for the country."

It is on this premise that several efforts are geared towards consciously providing the enabling environment for the MSMEs to thrive. This sub-sector needs special attention by the Government because the operatives are largely informal and financially very weak and at the same time they need to develop for the national economy to grow. The EBS 2012 shows that significant differences exist between formal enterprises and informal businesses in the areas of higher average staffing and a higher growth of staffing since business establishment. As in many developing countries, MSMEs in Nigeria have not achieved their full potential as a result of some critical inhibiting factors. These factors, which can be classified into internal and external, include among others:  Internal factors 1. Aversion to joint ownership 2. Family ties, i.e. bringing family into business. 3. Financial mismanagement 4. Lack of basic business capacity (knowledge, skills & attitude) 5. Non-recruitment of qualified personnel 6. Lack of perseverance and staying power when the business is going through tough times. 7. Poor record keeping especially accounting books 8. Lack of standardization of products 9. Being the all-in-all, i.e. managing director, accountant, cashier, admin. Manager, etc. 10. Low capacity to invest in R&D, ICT & E-commerce   11. Inadequate linkage to local & international supply chains 12. Limited access to markets. 13. Lack of exit/succession plan. 14. Declining business etiquette & disregard for contract sanctities.   External factors 1. Poor state of infrastructure 2. Weak access to production inputs (such as finance, workspace) & product markets etc. 3. Multiplicity of Taxes and levies plus red tape 4. Low access to information 5. Unfair competition with dumped products substitutes.  Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) play a crucial role in Nigeria’s economy, driving innovation, job creation, and economic growth. However, these SMEs face numerous challenges that hinder their progress and sustainability. We will explore the key challenges faced by SMEs in Nigeria today and provide practical solutions to help overcome them. 1. Limited Access to Finance Access to affordable finance remains a significant hurdle for SMEs in Nigeria. High-interest rates, stringent collateral requirements, and limited credit history make it difficult for these businesses to secure the funds they need to grow and expand.  2. Infrastructure Development Inadequate infrastructure, including unstable power supply, poor road networks, and limited technology access, hampers the productivity and efficiency of SMEs, leading to increased costs and operational challenges.  3. Limited Market Access and Competition SMEs often struggle to penetrate existing markets due to fierce competition from larger firms and a lack of market information. They need help accessing export markets and expanding beyond their local boundaries. 4. Inadequate Skills and Capacity The unavailability of skilled labor, including technical expertise, management capabilities, and entrepreneurial skills, poses a significant challenge for SMEs in Nigeria. The lack of a skilled workforce can hamper growth and innovation.  5. Regulatory and Administrative Burdens Complex regulatory frameworks, excessive bureaucracy, and corruption create barriers for SMEs in Nigeria. Cumbersome business registration processes, obtaining permits, and complying with tax regulations add to the administrative burden faced by SMEs.  ISSUES AND CHALLENGES It is undeniable that MSMEs are critical to employment generation and economic growth in Nigeria. The Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) has consistently strived to fulfill its responsibilities as outlined in the relevant legislation through cooperative efforts and partnerships. Nevertheless, various obstacles continue to impede its endeavors. Primarily, a thorough examination of the governing legislation elucidates that the primary purpose is to foster the promotion and growth of MSMEs, without extending to regulatory or supervisory functions. This presents a significant challenge, particularly considering the coexistence of MSMEs within both formal and informal sectors of the economy. What is more appalling is the growing number of businesses in the informal sector despite continuous efforts by the CAC as well as other stakeholders to ensure that businesses get registered in the country. The fact then remains that MSMEs in the informal sector are without any form of control or regulation, and this can have a ripple effect on the economy. An unregulated business environment results in stunted economic growth, lower standards, and ultimately market failure. At the same time, while SMEDAN’s mandate encompasses MSMEs broadly, its lack of regulatory authority leaves a substantial segment of the economy unregulated by statutory frameworks. Furthermore, an assessment of the operations of MSMEs and their attendant challenges in the Nigerian clime is critical evidence of the effectiveness of SMEDAN. Despite the agency’s developmental efforts over the years, MSMEs continue to face challenges such as insufficient entrepreneurial experience, poor funding, and under-capitalization, inadequate infrastructural facilities, poor record keeping by small business owners/managers, insecurity in parts of the country, inadequate credit control/loan default, poor time management, high investment in luxury assets, poor macro-economic conditions. These invariable casts a shadow on the effectiveness of the Agency’s training and developmental activities. Another impediment is the limited awareness of SMEDAN’s activities within the formal and informal sectors. As a result of this, only a fraction of MSMEs have access to the benefits offered by the Agency and this defeats the purpose of its establishment. If the Nigerian economy is to witness a radical reform through MSMEs then the Agency’s activities and services need to be more pronounced among them. Moreover, bureaucratic obstacles often prevent MSMEs from using SMEDAN’s support services. This is due to red-tapism, protracted and onerous administrative processes, and prolonged application processing times which can deter them from requesting support from the organization.  Empowering Nigeria’s Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs): Overcoming Challenges for Economic Prosperity Over time, Nigeria’s economy has significantly relied upon the oil and agricultural sectors as its primary pillars of growth and development. However, a notable paradigm shift has been observed as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have emerged as pivotal drivers of economic expansion within the country. These SMEs are critical in Nigeria’s economic landscape, contributing substantially to employment generation and gross domestic product (GDP).   According to the Nigerian Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency (SMEDAN), SMEs in Nigeria account for more than 50% of industrial employment and contribute approximately 48% to the country’s GDP. This remarkable contribution has not only propelled economic growth but has also garnered international recognition, showcasing the immense potential of Nigeria’s SME sector in fostering progress and advancement.   The contributions of SMEs encompass a wide array of aspects, including but not limited to job creation, economic diversification, local economic development, innovation, entrepreneurship, and poverty eradication. Despite their significant contributions, SMEs in Nigeria face a myriad of challenges, collectively referred to as the “Nigerian Factor.”   The term “Nigerian Factor” refers to the challenges and hindrances within Nigeria’s business environment that can impede the expansion and success of small and medium-sized enterprises. This article explores these challenges and discusses potential solutions to empower SMEs and cultivate a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem in Nigeria. The Challenges:   Limited Access to Financing: One of the predominant hurdles faced by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria revolves around the challenge of accessing viable financing options. According to the World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys for Nigeria, access to finance consistently emerges as a paramount business constraint. In the 2019 survey, 48% of Nigerian firms identified access to finance as a significant constraint, underscoring the pervasive nature of this issue. Despite numerous financial institutions in the country, SMEs often find themselves compelled to self-fund for various compelling reasons. These encompass onerous collateral prerequisites, excessively high interest rates, and the absence of an established credit history, impeding their capacity to secure loans.   To confront this pressing challenge, it is imperative that innovative financing avenues, such as Venture capital funds, angel investors, and microfinance organisations, furnish SMEs with specialised financial solutions tailored to their unique requirements. These alternatives offer the necessary support and flexibility that conventional lenders cannot provide, especially for SMEs with high-growth potential.   Furthermore, the government can play a pivotal role in redressing this issue by instating financial initiatives to furnish SMEs with favourable loan terms. Such initiatives empower SMEs to access the required funds more advantageously, enabling them to expand and prosper. Additionally, bolstering financial literacy among SME proprietors and entrepreneurs can substantially contribute to their proficiency in navigating the intricate financing terrain, comprehending loan conditions, and effectively managing their credit. This can be achieved through targeted training programs and workshops.   Inadequate Infrastructure: Nigeria faces significant infrastructure hurdles, including recurrent power interruptions, inadequate transportation systems, and limited access to reliable internet services. The World Bank’s annual Doing Business report consistently underscores these challenges. In the 2021 report, Nigeria ranked 171st out of 190 countries in the “Getting Electricity” category, indicating significant difficulties in securing dependable power. These obstacles place considerable financial burdens on businesses and hinder the smooth operations of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), constraining their long-term growth potential.   To tackle these issues, the government must prioritise infrastructure development, especially in areas densely populated with SMEs. This entails substantial investments in power generation and distribution systems to mitigate frequent outages, collaborating with a telecommunications company to expand broadband infrastructure for enhanced nationwide internet connectivity, and facilitating the effective use of digital tools and platforms for business operations, communication, and online market access. Additionally, enhancing transportation networks, encompassing roads, ports, and logistics infrastructure, will bolster connectivity and reduce transportation expenses for SMEs.   The government can also create a supportive environment conducive to SME growth by leveraging the potential of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure projects. This approach will alleviate the strain on public finances, ensuring efficient project implementation. Consequently, it will attract investments, foster entrepreneurial ventures, and stimulate economic growth, benefiting SMEs and the broader economy.   Exchange Rate Volatility: Nigeria’s recent adoption of rate unification or floating rate policies has substantially impacted small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), especially considering the country’s dependence on imports. The consequences of this policy on businesses will be contingent on various factors. However, the volatility in exchange rates can pose challenges for SMEs in terms of planning, budgeting, and handling their exposure to foreign exchange.   Research from the International Journal of Economics, Commerce, and Management (IJECM) underscores the significance of government involvement in aiding SMEs in dealing with currency risks. Providing access to hedging tools and implementing financial education programs can bolster SMEs’ capacity to withstand fluctuations in exchange rates (Reference: IJECM, Vol. 7, No. 2, February 2019).   SMEs can employ risk management techniques like hedging to mitigate potential currency risks. Hedging involves using financial instruments or methods to protect against unfavourable shifts in exchange rates. By implementing hedging strategies, SMEs can proficiently handle their exposure to currency fluctuations and decrease the potential adverse impact on their operations. Additionally, SMEs should closely monitor exchange rate dynamics, stay well-informed about market conditions, and seek expert guidance to determine the most suitable risk management strategies for their specific circumstances. This approach will enable them to make well-informed decisions regarding their exposure to foreign exchange.   Lack of Technological Adoption: A study by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in Nigeria indicated that a significant portion of SMEs in the country still operate with minimal or no technological integration in their business processes. This study highlighted that only a small percentage of SMEs had adopted modern technologies.   In Nigeria, adopting contemporary technology is paramount for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to enhance their competitiveness in the global market and achieve scalability.   However, many SMEs in the country still rely on outdated practices, significantly limiting their growth potential. To effectively address this issue and foster a conducive environment for technological advancement, the government must implement comprehensive measures that support the development of digital infrastructure and encourage SMEs to embrace technology, which can be done by providing robust training programs tailored to their specific needs. The World Bank, in its report on global competitiveness, has emphasised the crucial role of technology adoption for SMEs to stay competitive and thrive in today’s rapidly evolving business landscape.   These programs should offer comprehensive training and capacity-building initiatives to equip SME owners and employees with the necessary skills and knowledge to leverage contemporary technologies effectively. By enhancing their digital literacy and technical expertise, SMEs can overcome barriers and confidently embrace innovative tools and practices.   Inadequate Business Support Services: To effectively address the challenge of insufficient business support services for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), it is highly recommended that the government establish a supportive ecosystem. This can be achieved by establishing business development centres and incubation hubs nationwide. These centres would serve as knowledge hubs, providing SMEs with vital resources, mentoring, training programs, and access to market data. Furthermore, establishing such centres is intended to foster the growth, sustainability, and overall success of SMEs in the country.   Policy Inconsistencies and Regulatory Burdens: Policy inconsistencies and regulatory burdens for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria have been longstanding challenges that hinder the growth and development of this crucial sector. Here are some of the key aspects contributing to the problem:   – Frequent Policy Changes: SMEs in Nigeria often face challenges due to the frequent changes in policies and regulations. These sudden and unpredictable changes make it difficult for businesses to plan and invest long-term.   – Lack of Coordination: There is often a lack of coordination and coherence among various government agencies responsible for regulating SMEs. This leads to confusion and inefficiencies in compliance, as businesses may receive conflicting information from different sources.   – Complex Registration and Licensing Procedures: Registering and obtaining licenses for SMEs can be complex and time-consuming. This can discourage potential entrepreneurs and lead to a significant portion of the informal economy.   – Taxation and Multiple Levies: SMEs often face challenges related to taxation. There are multiple levels of taxation, including federal, state, and local government levies. The complexity and sometimes arbitrary nature of these taxes can significantly burden SMEs.   – Inconsistent Enforcement of Regulations: Even when regulations exist, enforcement can be inconsistent. This can lead to unfair competition and a lack of a level playing field for SMEs.   A comprehensive analysis conducted by the World Bank Group under the title “Doing Business 2020: Comparing Business Regulation in 190 Economies” underscores the profound impact of regulatory conditions on SMEs. It highlights the critical necessity of streamlining administrative procedures and simplifying regulatory frameworks to promote and support business development.   To promote the growth of SMEs, it is essential to streamline administrative processes, simplify regulatory frameworks, and establish policy consistency. By undertaking these measures, a more favourable business environment can be created, fostering the development and success of SMEs.   Corruption: Nigeria grapples with persistent corruption issues, with far-reaching consequences for its small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The World Bank conducts rigorous Enterprise Surveys to evaluate the business landscape across different nations, Nigeria included. These assessments consistently spotlight corruption-related hurdles SMEs encounter, such as irregular payments and bribery. Corruption takes on various forms, including bribery and extortion, creating significant barriers for SMEs when navigating official procedures, obtaining necessary permits, and accessing crucial resources. Furthermore, corruption erodes trust and confidence in the commercial sphere, making it increasingly challenging for SMEs to secure investments and establish valuable partnerships. Effectively tackling corruption is crucial for establishing a just and transparent business environment that nurtures the growth and prosperity of SMEs in Nigeria.   In summary, by empowering Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria and strategically resolving pertinent challenges, the nation stands poised to unleash the untapped potential within its SME sector. This, in turn, will catalyse a sustained surge in economic growth and overall development for the country"
**Starting an MSME in Nigeria** 2. **Business Registration and Legal Requirements** - CAC registration process.    - Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and VAT compliance.,"https://www.mondaq.com/nigeria/directors-and-officers/757432/small-and-medium-scale-enterprises-in-nigeria-an-overview-of-initial-set-up, https://www.cac.gov.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CAMA-NOTE-BOOK-FULL-VERSION.pdf","BUSINESS SETUP IN NIGERIA – PROCEDURE & LEGAL REQUIREMENTS There are various legal and regulatory requirements that must be met for a business set up in Nigeria. However, the requirements vary and depend on whether the promoters of the business entities are Nigerians or foreigners and the nature of the business to be carried out. The legal and regulatory requirements to be complied with before a full set-up and commencement of business in Nigeria are explained below. 1.   Registration with the Corporate Affairs Commission- This is typically the first step to take when setting up a business entity in Nigeria. The Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) is the regulatory body in charge of the registration of business entities in Nigeria. A business entity can choose to be registered as a business name, a limited liability company or a partnership depending on the suitability for the business type and the legal requirements for the business; however, the only type of business recommended for foreigners is the private company limited by shares. Section 78 of the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA), 2020, provides that any foreign company that wishes to carry on business in Nigeria must take steps to register in Nigeria as a separate entity before its commencement of business. The share capital requirement for companies varies with the Nationality of the promoters of the company; while Nigerians can register a company with a minimum of N100,000 authorized share capital, foreigners are required to have a minimum of N100,000,000 authorized share capital. A foreign-owned company must also have a minimum of 2 directors, and in some instances, it is mandatory to include a Nigerians as a director. Examples of such cases are companies engaging in oil & gas services and mining. 2. Tax Registration- After the business has been registered, the next step is to approach the Federal Inland Revenue Service for tax registration and clearance. At this stage, the Tax Identification Number (TIN) will be generated and activated for the company business. 3.   Registration with the NIPC- The Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) was established to monitor and encourage foreign portfolio investment and foreign direct investment in Nigeria. Foreign-owned companies are required to register with the NIPC. The company will be required to submit its incorporation documents, details of the company's business, and the amount to be invested in the company. The registration with NIPC guarantees foreign investments in Nigeria against any form of government takeover. 4.   Business Permit- This is required for foreign-owned companies, and it is obtained from the Federal Ministry of Interior. The requisite documents for the application include the company's incorporation documents, the business plan, a document showing that the company has secured a physical address to carry out its business, the evidence of capital importation, and evidence showing that the company is widely reputed in that line of business. 5.   Expatriate Quota- This is also issued by the Federal Ministry of Interior, and the application can be made together with the application for a business permit. It is required for employees or expatriates coming into Nigeria to reside for work purposes. While a business permit is required for the company itself, the expatriate quota is required for individual employees who wish to come to Nigeria to work. An expatriate quota will not be required if the company does not wish to send any director or employee to Nigeria to work.   6.   Resident Permit (CERPAC)- CERPAC is an acronym for Combined Expatriate Residential Permit and Alien Card. It is the permit that every foreigner must possess to work and reside in Nigeria validly. The CERPAC is obtained from the Nigerian Immigration Service upon the arrival of an expatriate in Nigeria with an STR Visa. 7.   Obtaining Licenses and Permits- The company should obtain the relevant industry licenses and permits before it commences its business. Each business must get a license or permit relevant to the industry where it operates or carries out its business. In most cases, failure to obtain the licenses may result in appropriate sanctions being levied on the company or inability to partake in the sector at all. 8. Bank Account Opening- It is expected that any person who wishes to carry on business in Nigeria must have an account through which the company can receive money from its transactions. All registered companies in Nigeria are eligible to open corporate accounts in multiple currencies such as Naira, GBP, USD and Euro. The director of the company must provide his/her bank verification number (BVN), passport photographs, means of identification, a completed and duly signed account opening form, and the company's incorporation documents shall be submitted to the bank before an account can be opened for such a company. 9.   Appointment of Company Secretary- The company secretary must be appointed by a foreign-owned company at the point of company registration. The company secretary has the duty to maintain the registers and books and file the annual returns for the company. Appointment of a secretary is only mandatory for a foreign-owned company; a company owned by Nigerian citizen(s) is not mandated to appoint a secretary; they can only do so for the proper administration or operation of the company. The business setup process in Nigeria is relatively seamless and fast. It is also important to note that some of these requirements can be processed simultaneously. It is also advisable to contact a professional to guide and offer professional advice on the appropriate procedure and requirements for a full company set up in Nigeria.    Types of Business Registrations in Nigeria Properly understanding the various types of business name registration done in Nigeria is essential. Meet Ademola, a brilliant ‘go-getter’ and entrepreneur who is excited to get his business running after finalizing market research.  He’s got the solution, team members, and the resources to get started, however, there’s one last detail. Ademola has to register his business correctly to be legally functional.    Whether it's you or Ade trying to kick start your entrepreneurial journey, there are many benefits of properly registering your business with the Corporate Affairs Commission in Nigeria. From building credibility, and attracting investors, to avoiding tax and legal complications, there are various pros of registering your business.  Now you might be wondering, what type of business registration to do and how to go about it. We’ll explore the types of business registration in Nigeria, their various requirements, and more. The Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) and Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) The Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) is the basic legal structure in Nigeria that forms the requirements for establishing, organizing, and managing businesses and companies.  The Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), on the other hand, is the legal body authorised with the obligation to regulate the management and formation of companies and businesses in Nigeria.  The CAC ensures that business owners comply with the CAMA ultimately ensuring the straightforward process of business registration. 8 Types of Business Registration in Nigeria 1. Sole Proprietorship Sole Proprietorship is one of the oldest forms of business operation in Nigeria. It is a type of business in which a person (known as a sole proprietor) owns and operates a business.  Also known as an enterprise or a ‘one-man business’, in a sole proprietorship business structure, the owner is legally the same as the business and bears the risks and liabilities incurred by the business.  However, a good fact about this business structure is that it gives the owner total control over decisions and access to the full profit. Additionally, it gives the owner the ability to operate a corporate business account like Moniepoint MFB under its name.  For instance, Florence who owns a thrift store can register her business with the CAC as a sole proprietorship where she makes the decisions, has access to the profit, and is responsible for the liabilities the business may incur.  2. Limited Partnership A Limited Partnership is a business that comprises at least one general partner, one limited partner, and not more than 20 partners. The general partners have unlimited personal liability, i.e., they are responsible for making business decisions and managing the business as a whole. Ademola, for instance, can register his business successfully with the CAC as a Limited Partnership and get his Certificate of Registration. On the other hand, the limited partners are those whose liabilities are limited to their investment in the business. Also known as silent partners, they are responsible for investing in the business rather than running the day-to-day operations.  Some examples of businesses that run this structure are real estate businesses, investment companies, etc, and this type of business registration can be done under a business name with the CAC.  3. Limited Liability Partnership A Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is a business structure consisting of two or more persons or corporations to make a profit. A distinguishing aspect of an LLP is that it is a legal entity separate from its owners who are liable for only the amount they invest in the business including personal guarantees.  Furthermore, an LLP can be seen as a combination of a corporation and a partnership and must have at least two partners (individuals, corporate partners’ nominees). Also, one of the partners must reside in Nigeria and ensure that the partnership complies with the regulations of the CAMA. 4. Private Limited Company A Private Limited Company is a business structure that operates as a ‘juristic person’, i.e., it can sue and be sued under its registered name. In an Ltd., it is required there must be at least 50 members with a minimum issued share capital of N100,000.  Additionally, the owners of a PLC are not liable for any act by the company and their liability is limited to their contribution to the memorandum and articles of association.  This means that their liability is limited to only the number of shares they own. A distinguishing aspect of a PLC is that it operates under a memorandum of association and its shares are private and cannot be traded on the public stock exchange market.   5. Public Limited Company A Public Limited Company (PLC) is among the types of company that can be registered with the CAC in Nigeria. This business entity is suitable for large companies like banks and its shares are traded publicly on the stock market.  Additionally, the law requires a PLC to annually publish their financial records for the sake of accountability and transparency.  This type of corporation must be registered by a minimum of two adults and have an operating share capital of N2,000,000. 6. Company Limited by Guarantee This type of company can be referred to as a “non-profit organization” and they are registered not for the aim of earning profits but to promote art, commerce, religion, etc.  It doesn’t have a share capital and the guarantors don’t claim any profit, thereby having no claim to the company’s assets.  The liability of the members is limited to the amount they undertake in contribution to the company’s assets. Ultimately, all income the company generates is utilized in covering operational costs and achieving its objectives. 7. Private Unlimited Company This type of company is a rare type of business registration done in Nigeria in which the shareholders have unlimited personal liability for the obligations and debt of the company. Overall, what this means is that the members have a non-limited and joint responsibility to clear the company’s liabilities. 8. Incorporated Trustees This entity is not a business organization but a non-governmental organization that consists of one or more trustees appointed by a group of people bound by religion, custom, etc.  There are no share capital or shareholders but it is run by a board of trustees. Furthermore, Trustees can be a Church, Mosque, Charity organization, etc, and usually have a chairman and secretary managing their affairs.   Requirements for the Types of Business Registration in Nigeria We’ve seen the various types of business registrations you can do for your entities with the CAC in Nigeria. Let’s see the various requirements for registering each one of them; 1. Business Name: To register a business name with the CAC in Nigeria, the requirements include; 2 Preferred business names Your Business Address Your Residential Address The Nature of your business company, Identification Card, i.e., National Identity Card (NIN), voter's card, or driver's license. Your Passport Photograph Your Phone Number Your email address 2. Company: When registering various types of companies in Nigeria, you must provide the following requirements; Two preferred names for your company Company Address Nature of Business Residential Address Articles of Association Share Allotment Email Phone Number ID Card of Directors Signature of Directors 3. Trustees: The following requirements must be provided when you want to register your Trustee with the CAC in Nigeria; Two preferred names for your Organisation Organisation Address Residential Address Aim and Objectives Phone Number Email 2 Passport photographs for each Trustee board member ID Card of Trustees Signature  Reservation and Registration of Company/Business name A prospective business owner will be expected to have chosen at least two possible names which are unique, suitable and not controversial or inconsistent with the provisions of the regulatory laws, and conduct an availability search by filling and filing the necessary forms to ensure that the names are suitable for registration. Upon the approval of a suitable name, an application is made to the Commission after the payment of the necessary fees for the reservation of the chosen name. The reservation shall be for a period of sixty (60) days, during which no other company shall be registered under the reserved name. The implication of this is that an applicant has a window of sixty (60) days within which to resume (and complete) the process of registration of the company in the reserved name, and has the sole right to the use of the name. At the expiration of the sixty (60) days window, any other person can apply for the use of the name, and the previous applicant shall have no right to claim exclusivity to the name, unless he applies for another reservation of the said name immediately the previous reservation expires. It is pertinent to note that with the Federal Government's drive on improving business in Nigeria, registration at the Corporate Affairs Commission can now be carried out from start to finish online. Making a Company Seal/Stamp Upon the registration of a company, the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) requires such a company to get a company seal (stamp for business names) which will be used on documents executed by the company. Registration for Income Tax and VAT This is regulated by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) The Inland Revenue Services of the state in which business names are located also regulate the collection of these taxes. This enables the company make returns on Company Gains Income Tax (CGIT) and the Value Added Tax (VAT) payable by it. Payments are still made manually through designated Banks, although there are ongoing plans to implement online payments. A taxable person/company is expected to register with the FIRS Board within six (6) months of commencement of business. Failure/Refusal to register with the Board amounts to an offence punishable under the law.  Registration for Personal Income Tax (PAYE) Upon registration at the appropriate authority, an Employer's Tax Identification Number (TIN) will be issued with which payments will be made in favor of employees. It is expected that each employee must have generated their individual TIN. The TIN is a unique means of identification for a company or for an individual, specifically for the purpose of tax remittance. It is prepared and issued by the tax office upon application. The essence of the TIN is to show that the business owner/individual is a registered tax payer in Nigeria. Failure to register attracts a penalty in addition to payment of arrears of the tax due. It is pertinent to note however, that Incorporated Trustees do not require TIN since they are non- profit making organizations. Apart from a means of identifying a tax payer, the TIN is necessary to open a Business account, for acquiring licences related to trade, import and export, for foreign exchange and receipt of capital importation; to obtain tax incentives, waivers and tax allowances; and to obtain Tax Clearance Certificates for employees. PAYE registrations are done by filling out the necessary forms at the designated tax office. Registration with Regulatory Authority Every business is expected to register with the Regulatory body under which its business is categorized. This is to ensure compliance with the expected best practices of the sector. Upon satisfaction of the enumerated procedure, an SME can conduct business in Nigeria. SMEs are required to keep the Statutory Books as prescribed under CAMA, depending on the type of company/business. These include:  Register of Members used to record the names and particulars of previous and existing members, including their shareholding. It should also include the date each person became a member or ceased to be a member. This applies to all types of companies, whether public or private.  Register of Directors and Secretaries reflecting the names and particulars of past and present Directors and Secretary, also specifying the date on which they assumed or left office. A company shall not have less than two (2) directors at any given time. Where such happens, the company shall within one month of the shortfall, appoint new directors to the company. It is pertinent to note that the Law shall hold liable a Director (or member) of a company who knows that a company carries on business after the number of directors has fallen below two for more than sixty (60) days. Minutes Book. The minutes book is a record of all proceedings of meetings signed by the Chairman (and Secretary) as evidence of what transpired in the meeting. It should be available for inspection at any time during a business day. Accounting Records This is the financial record of the company showing and explaining the transactions embarked upon and the It is pertinent to note that the financial statement of a company is expected to be filed yearly at the Corporate Affairs Commission. Failure to do so within the stipulated period attracts a penalty, and also limits the company's ability to do any other form of filings with the Commission.  Index of Directors Shareholding. This book records the shares (or debentures) of the Directors in the company. It is a mandatory book to be kept by public and private limited liability companies (LLCs). Register of Debenture Holder is the record of names and particulars of debenture holders and the details of the terms of issue. This record should be updated within thirty (30) days of creation of the debentures, and also within thirty (30) days after such persons ceased to become debenture holders. It is a mandatory requirement for Limited and unlimited companies, whether Public or Private.  Register of Charges for records of fixed and floating charges created by the company on its assets. It is also a mandatory book to be kept by private and public limited liability Companies. Index of Members, showing the number of members in a public limited company. The law stipulates that companies having more than fifty (50) members are mandated to keep an index of its members.  Register of Substantial Interest in Shares which keeps a record of persons who have acquired at least 10% voting rights in a Public company.

**Growing and Sustaining Your MSME**  1. **Access to Markets**    - Export opportunities for Nigerian MSMEs.    - Participating in trade fairs and exhibitions.,"https://growth4her.org/selling-more-than-products-the-role-of-trade-fairs-on-business-growth/,https://smeguide.net/export-strategies-for-nigerian-smes-tapping-into-global-markets-during-local-economic-challenges/","Understanding the Nigerian SME Sector Before delving into export strategies, it’s crucial to understand the current state of Nigerian SMEs. Small and medium enterprises form the backbone of Nigeria’s economy, contributing significantly to employment and GDP. According to the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN), SMEs account for about 96% of Nigerian businesses and contribute 48% to the national GDP.   Despite their importance, Nigerian SMEs face numerous challenges:  Limited access to finance Infrastructural deficits Inconsistent government policies Skill gaps Technology adoption hurdles Market access limitations These challenges are often exacerbated during periods of economic downturn, making it imperative for SMEs to explore alternative growth strategies, such as exporting.  The Case for Exporting Exporting presents numerous benefits for Nigerian SMEs, including:  Market Expansion: Exporting allows businesses to tap into new customer bases and diversify their market presence. Increased Revenue: Access to international markets can lead to higher sales volumes and improved profitability. Risk Mitigation: By operating in multiple markets, SMEs can reduce their dependence on the local economy. Enhanced Competitiveness: Exposure to international standards can drive innovation and improve product quality. Foreign Exchange Earnings: Exporting brings in foreign currency, which is particularly valuable during periods of local currency depreciation. Job Creation: As businesses grow through exports, they often need to hire more staff, contributing to local employment. Identifying export opportunities The first step in developing an export strategy is identifying viable opportunities. Nigerian SMEs should consider the following approaches:  Market Research: Conduct thorough research to identify countries with demand for your products or services. Consider factors such as market size, competition, cultural affinity, and trade regulations. Product-Market Fit: Assess how well your existing products or services align with the needs of potential export markets. Be prepared to adapt or modify your offerings if necessary. Competitive Analysis: Understand who your competitors are in target markets and how your products or services compare in terms of quality, price, and unique selling propositions. Trade Data Analysis: Utilise resources like the International Trade Centre’s Trade Map to analyse trade flows and identify growing markets for your products. Leverage Diaspora Networks: Nigerian communities abroad can provide valuable insights into local markets and potentially serve as initial customers or partners. Attend International Trade Fairs: Participate in relevant international trade shows to gauge interest in your products and make valuable connections. Preparing for export Once export opportunities are identified, SMEs need to prepare their businesses for international trade. This involves several key steps:  Legal and Regulatory Compliance: Ensure your business complies with both Nigerian export regulations and the import regulations of target countries. This may involve obtaining necessary licenses, certifications, or permits. Product Adaptation: Modify your products or packaging to meet international standards and local preferences in target markets. This might include changes in labelling, sizing, or ingredients. Pricing Strategy: Develop a competitive pricing strategy that accounts for additional costs associated with exporting, such as shipping, tariffs, and currency exchange rates. Intellectual Property Protection: Protect your trademarks, patents, or copyrights in target markets to prevent intellectual property infringement. Quality Control: Implement rigorous quality control measures to ensure your products consistently meet international standards. Export Documentation: Familiarise yourself with the required export documentation, including commercial invoices, certificates of origin, and bills of lading. Financial preparation: Secure adequate financing to support your export activities. This may involve working with banks that offer export financing or exploring government export support programmes. Developing an Export Marketing Strategy A well-crafted export marketing strategy is crucial for success in international markets. Consider the following elements:  Brand Positioning: Determine how you want your brand to be perceived in the target market. This may differ from your domestic position. Marketing Mix: Adapt your product, price, place, and promotion strategies to suit the target market. Product: Consider local preferences and regulations. Price: Account for export costs and local market conditions. Place: Choose appropriate distribution channels. Promotion: Tailor your marketing messages and channels to the local culture and media landscape. Digital Presence: Develop a strong online presence, including a website optimised for international audiences and engagement on relevant social media platforms. Localization: Adapt your marketing materials, including website content, product descriptions, and promotional materials, to the local language and cultural context. Relationship Building: Invest time in building relationships with potential customers, partners, and distributors in your target markets. Customer Service: Develop a strategy for providing excellent customer service across borders, considering factors like time zones and language barriers. Choosing the Right Export Mode Nigerian SMEs have several options for entering export markets:  Direct exporting: selling directly to customers in foreign markets. This offers more control but requires more resources and expertise. Indirect Exporting: Using intermediaries such as export management companies or trading houses. This can be a good option for SMEs new to exporting. Licensing: Granting foreign companies the right to produce and sell your products in their markets. This can be a low-risk way to enter new markets. Joint Ventures: Partnering with a local company in the target market. This can provide valuable local knowledge and resources. E-commerce: selling products directly to international consumers through online platforms. This can be an effective way to reach global markets with minimal upfront investment. The choice of export mode will depend on factors such as your resources, expertise, product type, and target market characteristics.  Navigating Logistics and Supply Chain Challenges Efficient logistics and supply chain management are critical for successful exporting. Nigerian SMEs should consider the following:  Transportation: Choose the most appropriate mode of transportation (sea, air, or road) based on your product type, destination, and urgency. Packaging: Ensure your products are packaged appropriately for international shipping, considering factors like climate, handling, and customs requirements. Inventory Management: Develop a system to manage inventory effectively across multiple markets, balancing stock levels with demand forecasts. Customs Clearance: Understand the customs procedures in both Nigeria and the destination countries. Consider working with a customs broker to navigate complex regulations. Insurance: Obtain appropriate insurance coverage for your exports to protect against loss or damage during transit. Technology Adoption: Implement logistics management software to track shipments, manage inventory, and streamline operations. Local Partnerships: Consider partnering with local logistics providers in your target markets to ensure efficient last-mile delivery. Financial Management for Exports Exporting introduces new financial considerations for SMEs:  Payment Methods: Understand different international payment methods (e.g., letters of credit, and wire transfers) and choose the most appropriate for your business and customers. Currency Management: Develop strategies to manage currency exchange risks, such as forward contracts or hedging. Working Capital: Ensure you have sufficient working capital to manage the longer cash conversion cycles often associated with international trade. Pricing Strategy: Develop a pricing strategy that accounts for all export-related costs while remaining competitive in the target market. Tax Implications: Understand the tax implications of your export activities, both in Nigeria and in destination countries. Export Financing: Explore export financing options, including government-backed export credit agencies and international trade finance products offered by banks. Leveraging Technology for Export Success Technology can play a crucial role in helping Nigerian SMEs compete in global markets.  E-commerce Platforms: Utilise international e-commerce platforms to reach global customers directly. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems: Implement CRM software to manage international customer relationships effectively. Digital Marketing Tools: Use digital marketing tools and analytics to target and engage international audiences cost-effectively. Supply Chain Management Software: Implement software solutions to optimise your international supply chain operations. Communication Tools: Leverage digital communication tools to collaborate with international partners and customers efficiently. Market Intelligence Platforms: Use online market intelligence platforms to gather data on international markets and competitors. Blockchain Technology: Consider blockchain solutions for secure, transparent international transactions and supply chain management. Government Support and Export Promotion Programmes Nigerian SMEs can benefit from various government initiatives aimed at promoting exports.  Export Expansion Grant (EEG): A post-shipment incentive designed to encourage export-oriented activities. Export Development Fund: Provides financial assistance to exporters for export promotion activities. Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC): Offers various support services, including market information, capacity building, and export promotion. Export Processing Zones: Take advantage of incentives offered in Nigeria’s export processing zones. Trade Missions: Participate in government-organised trade missions to explore new markets. Export Credit Insurance: Utilise export credit insurance schemes to mitigate risks associated with international trade. SMEs should stay informed about these programmes and actively engage with relevant government agencies to access the available support.  Building export capabilities Developing internal capabilities is crucial for long-term export success.  Staff Training: Invest in training your team in international trade practices, cross-cultural communication, and export regulations. Language Skills: Develop language capabilities relevant to your target markets, either through hiring or training existing staff. International Business Culture: Educate your team about business cultures and practices in target markets to avoid misunderstandings. Export Compliance: Establish robust export compliance procedures to ensure adherence to both Nigerian and international trade regulations. Quality Management: Implement international quality management standards like ISO 9001 to enhance credibility in global markets. Continuous Learning: Stay updated on international trade developments, market trends, and best practices through ongoing education and networking. Case Studies: Successful Nigerian SME Exporters To illustrate the potential of exporting for Nigerian SMEs, consider these brief case studies:  Beloxxi Industries Limited: This biscuit manufacturer successfully expanded into West African markets and beyond, leveraging quality products and strategic partnerships. Lufodo Productions: This entertainment company exported Nigerian films and TV shows to international markets, tapping into the global demand for African content. Slimtrader: This technology company expanded its mobile commerce solutions to other African countries, addressing similar market needs across the continent. These examples demonstrate how Nigerian SMEs can successfully navigate the challenges of exporting and achieve growth in international markets.  Overcoming common export challenges Nigerian SMEs often face several challenges when venturing into exports:  Access to Finance: Partner with banks offering export finance, explore government support programmes or consider alternative financing options like crowdfunding or peer-to-peer lending. Regulatory Compliance: Stay informed about export regulations and consider working with a compliance consultant to navigate complex requirements. Cultural Differences: Invest time in understanding the cultural nuances of your target markets and adapt your approach accordingly. Competition: Differentiate your offerings through quality, innovation, or unique value propositions to stand out in competitive international markets. Logistics Costs: Optimise your supply chain, consider consolidating shipments, and explore partnerships with logistics providers to manage costs. Payment Risks: Use secure payment methods like letters of credit or consider export credit insurance to mitigate payment risks. Market Information: Leverage resources provided by organisations like the Nigerian Export Promotion Council and international trade databases to gather market intelligence. Future Outlook for Nigerian SME Exports The future holds both challenges and opportunities for Nigerian SME exporters:  Digital Transformation: The continued growth of e-commerce and digital platforms will create new opportunities for SMEs to reach global markets directly. Regional Integration: The implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement could open up new markets across the continent. Sustainability Focus: A growing global emphasis on sustainability could create opportunities for SMEs offering eco-friendly or ethically produced goods. Niche Markets: Increasing global interest in unique, artisanal products could benefit Nigerian SMEs offering traditional or handcrafted items. Services Exports: The growth of the digital economy could create more opportunities for Nigerian SMEs to export services, particularly in areas like IT and creative industries. Value-Added Exports: There may be increasing opportunities to export value-added products rather than raw materials, particularly in the agricultural sector. Conclusion Exporting presents a significant opportunity for Nigerian SMEs to grow and thrive, even in the face of domestic economic challenges. By developing a strategic approach to international markets, leveraging available resources and support, and building the necessary capabilities, SMEs can successfully tap into the vast potential of global trade.  The journey to becoming a successful exporter requires careful planning, perseverance, and adaptability. It’s crucial for SMEs to start with thorough market research, develop a solid export plan, and be prepared to continuously learn and adapt to the dynamics of international markets.  While the challenges are real, the potential rewards of exporting—including increased revenue, improved competitiveness, and reduced dependence on the local economy—make it a compelling growth strategy for Nigerian SMEs.  As Nigeria continues to position itself as a key player in the global economy, its SMEs have a crucial role to play. By embracing export opportunities, these businesses can not only drive their own growth but also contribute significantly to Nigeria’s economic development and diversification.  The path to export success may not be easy, but with the right strategies, support, and determination, Nigerian SMEs can indeed tap into global markets and thrive on the international stage.   Trade fairs or exhibitions are events where businesses from a specific industry showcase their products, services, or innovations to potential buyers, partners, and other stakeholders. They have been essential to business development, offering a unique blend of promotion, networking, and market research. Whether you’re a startup or a well-established company, the benefits of participating in these events can be far-reaching.  Exhibiting at trade fairs requires significant investment—both in terms of time and money—the benefits typically outweigh the costs. Recently, the Naija Brand Chick Fair has expanded its reach beyond Nigeria. The trade fair has been quite successful in the Nigerian market, but it has dared to explore new opportunities for vendors and business owners in the international market. However, this moves evoked mixed reactions, inspiring this post on the different perspectives on Trade Fairs, especially for business owners. Some opined that it’s unwise to make such a significant financial investment in exhibiting goods outside the country, considering the country’s current economic situation, as some of those products are already widely available in the London market, which may result in low sales at the fair. On the other hand, some believe it’s an excellent opportunity to increase brand visibility and positioning. When carefully aligned with business goals, trade fairs offer more than just a return on investment; they help build relationships, boost brand awareness, and provide market insights that fuel long-term growth. Sales are undoubtedly a significant outcome of trade fairs; the benefits often extend far beyond. Trade Fairs and Exhibitions events serve as powerful platforms for: Brand Visibility and Awareness: Exhibiting at a trade fair can significantly boost your brand’s visibility among target audiences. By showcasing your products or services in a focused environment, you can reach potential customers who have yet to learn about your business. Networking and Relationship Building: Trade fairs provide excellent opportunities to connect with industry peers, potential partners, and customers. Networking can lead to new collaborations, partnerships, and valuable insights into market trends. Market Research and Analysis: Observing competitor activities and gathering feedback from attendees can provide valuable market intelligence. This information can help you refine your business strategies and identify emerging trends. Employee Motivation and Development: Participating in trade fairs can be a motivating experience for your team. It allows them to showcase their work, learn from industry experts, and gain valuable experience. The recent expansion of the Naija Brand Chick Fair to international shores is a testament to trade fairs’ potential to drive business growth. Despite concerns about market saturation, the event proved successful, demonstrating value beyond immediate sales. While participating in trade fairs can be a significant investment, the long-term benefits often outweigh the costs. By carefully considering your goals, target audience, and the fair’s value proposition, you can make informed decisions and maximize your return on investment. Participating in trade fairs and exhibitions is about more than just immediate sales. It’s a strategic move that can enhance your brand visibility and foster new relationships, collaborations, and partnerships. These long-term benefits can be invaluable for your business growth, reassuring you that your investment in trade fairs is a sound decision.

Company Income Tax (CIT) Company Income Tax is charged on the profits of limited liability companies by the Nigerian government.  File your annual CIT returns and pay the tax within six months of your financial year-end to avoid fines. Late payments attract a penalty of 25,000 Naira for the first month and 5,000 Naira for each subsequent month.  2. Personal Income Tax (PIT) Personal Income Tax is levied on the income of individuals living in Nigeria. As a business owner, you must pay PIT on your business profits.  PIT rates range from 7% to 24%, depending on your income bracket.  If you have employees, deduct PAYE (Pay As You Earn) from their salaries and remit it to the tax authorities by the 10th of each month.  3. Value Added Tax (VAT) Value Added Tax, or VAT, is a consumption tax on goods and services sold to the public. Registered businesses must collect VAT on sales and remit it to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) monthly. The VAT rate is 7.5%, though some items, like basic food, medical products, books, and agricultural products, are exempt. Failing to pay VAT can result in a 5% per annum penalty plus interest. Not registering for VAT incurs a 10,000 Naira penalty for the first month and 5,000 Naira for each following month.   4. Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Capital Gains Tax applies to profits from selling capital assets like land, buildings, stocks, and shares. The CGT rate in Nigeria is 10%, payable by the seller of the asset.  5. Business Premises Tax (BPT) State governments levy Business Premises Tax on properties used for business, such as offices, factories, and shops. Rates vary by state and property location.  6. Customs Duties Customs duties are taxes on imported goods, with rates ranging from 5% to 35%, depending on the type of goods.  7. Stamp Duty Tax Stamp duty is imposed on the transfer of legal documents, including homes, buildings, copyrights, land, patents, and securities. Documents must be stamped within 40 days of execution. Stamp duty amounts vary: some have fixed rates, while others are ad valorem, meaning the duty increases with the transaction value.  Calculating and Paying Taxes for Small Businesses in Nigeria First, identify the taxes your business must pay. Each tax has its rates, and your annual revenue determines the amount you owe.  Penalties for Non-Compliance For example, Company Income Tax must be paid within six months after the fiscal year or 18 months from incorporation for new businesses. Failure to file means a N25,000 penalty for the first month and N5,000 for each following month, plus interest.  Tax Requirements for Nigerian Businesses Documents you typically need include:  Tax Identification Number (TIN): Issued when registering with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). Audited Financial Statement: A yearly overview of your business’s finances, prepared according to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Self-Assessment Form: Declares your estimated tax liability. Additional documents may be needed depending on the specific tax.  How to Pay Tax as a Small Business in Nigeria Paying taxes involves several steps, but it’s manageable:  Step 1: Register Your Business Register with the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and your state’s tax authority. Visit their office or website and complete the necessary forms with your business details.  Step 2: Identify Applicable Taxes Determine which taxes apply to your business based on factors like location and type. Monitor your expenses and profits to calculate your taxable income and review financial statements for deductions and allowances.  Step 3: Fill Out a Self-Assessment Form This form estimates your tax for the year. Get the form from the tax authority’s office or website, and carefully provide details about your business, income, and tax amount due.  Step 4: File Your Tax Returns Gather essential documents like your annual financial statement, CAC documents, directors’ statements, and the completed self-assessment form. File returns via the FIRS or the appropriate state tax authority’s online portal.  Step 5: Pay Your Tax Pay at a bank or through the tax authority’s website. Keep your TIN and other tax documents handy during payment.  Step 6: Keep Thorough Records Save receipts, financial statements, and tax returns for at least six years. These records are vital for audits and proving compliance to stakeholders like investors, lenders, customers, or suppliers.  Conclusion Understanding tax basics for small businesses in Nigeria helps you make informed decisions, ensuring your business can leverage any tax benefits. Complying with tax regulations protects you from penalties and boosts your credibility with customers and investors  Pay Your Income Tax with Taxpal If you’re a professional or business owner in Nigeria, simplify your tax process with Taxpal.  Our platform takes care of the tedious tasks like tax computation, documentation, and compliance, so you can focus on what you do best—growing your business.   Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of Nigeria’s economy, driving innovation, creating jobs, and contributing significantly to economic growth. Recognizing the vital role played by SMEs, the Nigeria Finance Act of 2019 introduces a range of tax incentives to support their development and foster a conducive business environment. As a leading accounting firm in Nigeria, we explore the tax incentives provided under the Nigeria Finance Act 2019 and their potential impact on SMEs. 1. Value Added Tax (VAT) Exemption Threshold: The Finance Act 2019 raises the VAT exemption threshold for SMEs, providing significant relief for businesses with an annual turnover of 25 million Naira or less. SMEs falling within this threshold are now exempt from registering for and charging VAT on their goods and services. This measure aims to ease the administrative burden for smaller businesses and stimulate growth in the sector. Implication: The VAT exemption threshold allows SMEs to retain a larger portion of their revenue, enhancing their competitiveness and financial sustainability. It encourages growth and investment in SMEs, contributing to job creation and economic development. 2. Export Expansion Grant (EEG) Scheme: The Finance Act 2019 reinstates the Export Expansion Grant (EEG) scheme, which provides incentives to SMEs engaged in non-oil exports. Under this scheme, eligible SMEs are entitled to a grant calculated based on the value of their non-oil export volume. The reintroduction of the EEG seeks to promote export-oriented activities and reduce reliance on oil revenues. Implication: The EEG scheme incentivizes SMEs to explore international markets and diversify their revenue streams through non-oil exports. By accessing the grant, SMEs can improve their competitiveness in the global market and boost foreign exchange earnings for Nigeria. 3. Pioneer Status Incentive: The Finance Act 2019 extends the pioneer status incentive to SMEs, offering qualifying businesses a tax holiday for an initial period of three years. SMEs engaged in pioneer industries that contribute to economic development and technology transfer may be eligible for this incentive. The pioneer status provides relief from corporate income tax, allowing SMEs to channel their resources towards growth and expansion. Implication: The pioneer status incentive encourages SMEs to invest in priority sectors and innovative industries, supporting economic diversification and sustainable development. SMEs can take advantage of the tax holiday to strengthen their competitiveness and establish a solid foundation for long-term success. 4. Minimum Tax Exemption: The Finance Act 2019 exempts SMEs with an annual turnover of 25 million Naira or less from paying minimum tax. Minimum tax is typically based on a percentage of gross turnover and applies regardless of profitability. By exempting qualifying SMEs, the Act reduces their tax burden and provides breathing space during early stages of growth. Implication: The minimum tax exemption provides a lifeline for SMEs during the critical initial years, allowing them to allocate resources strategically to expand their operations, hire more employees, and innovate. Conclusion: The Nigeria Finance Act 2019 demonstrates the government’s commitment to supporting SMEs as engines of economic growth and job creation. By providing tax incentives such as the VAT exemption threshold, the Export Expansion Grant (EEG) scheme, pioneer status incentives, and minimum tax exemption, the Act empowers SMEs to thrive in a competitive business environment. As an accounting firm in Nigeria, we encourage SMEs to take advantage of these tax incentives and leverage them to boost their financial resilience and competitiveness. By understanding and optimizing these provisions, SMEs can chart a path towards sustainable growth, contributing significantly to Nigeria’s economic prosperity and development.  Tax Reforms on SME’s: A discussion  The Nigerian government officially gazatted two major fiscal reforms, the deduction of tax at source withholding regulations 2024 and the value added tax modification order 2024.  These reforms introduce significant changes to tax landscape aiming to provide relief to businesses and support clean energy adoption. The withholding tax regulations Grant tax rate reductions and exemptions to businesses especially MSMEs with an annual turn over below 25 million naira with implementation beginning in January 2025. Now talking about the vat modification order 2024, it formalizes the suspension of VAT on diesel and extends vat exemptions to critical areas such as compressed natural gas electric vehicles bio gas and biofuel equipment emphasizing the continous shift toward clean energy for cooking and transportation. Now on the presidential committee on fiscal policy and tax reforms, they presented some of these recommendations to us earlier in May to stakeholders and media, I mean it's so good to see that some of these recommendations have been gazatted, what do you make of the process so far you know they had timelines, there was a three months, there was the six month how has it been so far for you? I expected that things would pan out exactly the way I've seen them, government is not the most straightforward and efficient in terms of ability to Implement things very quickly so when initially the presidential committee on fiscal reforms and tax policy commenced, the expectation was that it would last for about a year, in the Nigerian context that's almost impossible because you would have to engage several stakeholders and carry different people along and one of the things I will give you an insight into the process is this withholding tax regulations for example had been released in July right. There was a version that was out in June, July and people were wondering whether to implement or not to implement because it was not gazetted and we've waited since June July up till now to finally see one published, so I would say the performance overall of the committee has been good because within those restrictions and the bureaucracy of government they've been able to you know deliver some positive outcomes, you know some of them we've seen through executive orders and now these two you know gazetted orders in quick succession of the vat exemption, modification order and the withholding tax order, so I would say overall very good but the big one we're waiting for is the economic stabilization Bill, the final implementation because in there, there are several things that the committee, the big ticket items, that the committee has been working on, that implementation would crystallize, of course the one around tax identification and the harmonization of that. Harmonization very important especially in the context of the different tax authorities and agencies federal states and local governmenand for businesses, you know, dealing with several of them becomes a bit complicated, so, harmonization is one of the things the business Community has been calling for and then you would also see a reform of the various tax legislation, vat, withholding tax, you know rather company's income tax, even the petroleum industry Act, petroleum profits tax, capital gains tax, so what I understand is that there would be a total transformation and overhaul of the various tax legislation. Now let's talk about the vat modification order 2024, talk to us about you know the offerings and expected impact you know on the everyday Nigerian. So when I look at the bill even though it wasn't exactly stated there, well, the order not the bill, even though it's not exactly stated there, I see some very important strategies I think three of them, the first one is the recognition of the government of the challenges in terms of energy prices for Nigerians today so this is everything in the downstream petroleum space whether it be you know diesel, petrol, and even electricity, you know trying to deal with that and ensuring that at least from a fiscal side, the government is granting some relief, so recognizing the challenges for Nigerians and also responding to that, I think the other thing you know principle which I also uncovered there is that Nigeria recognized you know gas as a very important transition, you know element in achieving our Net Zero targets, so you know you can't just switch off from crude or hydrocarbons and Transit immediately to Renewables, and as you can imagine, Nigeria is largely a significant gas Reserve Nation so the ability to unlock that would be important and so the vat modification order sort of tries to incentivize the gas value chain by you know incentivizing the importation of equipment related to LPG, compressed natural gas, you know the bse's and all that. Then you know also recognizing the fact that we also need to achieve our Net Zero targets, you know Nigeria passed the climate change act a while back and one of the important targets is that by 2060 we would achieve Net Zero targets.  Well that is important I mean one of the things I did was also to measure the response of Nigerians on social media and I saw a lot of them asking questions about what about food, what about agriculture, what about health and all of those, are those captured here? because there has there have been a lot of announcements pronouncements so far so sometimes you know trying to put everything together can be a lot of work so talking about food whether it's agriculture or health where do all of this stand in this particular document you wouldn't see it in the document because and I think some work still needs to be done but currently most of the services in the health and medical space is already exempt from vat so you go see it a doctor or you're purchasing medical equipment all of that is vat exempt already and there was an additional executive executive order in June where the president announced that there will be no import duties and VAT on medical and pharmaceutical um equipment as well as inputs so that is already operational right same for food right basic food items are exempt but the Big Challenge from a Nigerian perspective is not the exemption for those items we expect them to be zero rated so the difference is that for Exempted items their costs will still have vat but for zero rated items their costs will also not have vat so every input in the value chain would be recoverable because it's zero rated to the customer and that's what businesses are expecting in that space so if you're exempting you're only reducing the vat on The Last Mile you have to remove the vat across the value chain and exemption doesn't do that my expectation is that when the overhaul of the vat act happens that those very critical elements like health education you know food they would be zero rated and that would you know ensure that the pricing structure across comes to the final consumer so for me I think that's key of course there's also an expectation like you would know because in the past this conversation had popped up whether the VAT rate was being going to be increased of course I mean I even heard him talk about it this morning on the station so he was also answering that particular big question so how about the fact that you know for things you've called nonessential and luxury we're going to have additional 2.5% has that started when is that starting is it part of this particular modification order that we've already seen this fat modification order doesn't touch on that so it will be the outcome of the economic stabilization bill so there's a lot of things to keep track of there's a lot as you can imagine to reform the fiscal space in this country you can't do it overnight so it would take a lot of effort but I think what need you know intends to do is to harmonize with the rest of the echas region because we are committed to that and that would you know mean that we have to increase our vat rate however the difference between Nigeria and the other countries in West Africa is that the ability to claim input vat is very limited in Nigeria so if government is going to increase the rate of vat on non-essentials my expectation is that they should expand the base on which businesses can claim relief for the vat they incure on their expenses when that happens I think businesses may not be too worried I think the other element that a common man would obviously raise an eyebrow to is you know the categorization of things called  non-essentials so if you put them inone bucket what about luxury items you know why would the Common Man be paying exactly the same value rate for things relating to you know even though they've removed it on transport but clothes and things like that but a yacht and a private jet is paying the same Vat rate a sound principle of fiscal policy would you know expect that government puts a bit more pressure on those luxury items in order to fund infrastructure for the poor and the vulnerable so for me I think that that would be one thing I would like to see I'm not so sure it's been sufficiently covered but I haven't seen the vat bill yet it will be interesting to see whether that's in there okay I think I forwarded something to you earlier but that's by the way now as there you know maybe some criteria or some things to consider before qualifying for certain things at the moment not well let me say first of all you know know the law is clear the law doesn't place a demand but practical implementation there might be practical requirements placed on people to claim some of these exemptions or benefits especially when you're importing so if you're importing you know some of these items you know as you can imagine at the Port the Nigerian Customs will want to be able to distinguish whether those items are used for the purpose which the exempt was granted or not so there is a process called the import Duty exemption where the grant a certificate through the Ministry of Finance where they look at the items that you're importing and check it against the exemption list so even though the law doesn't place that requirement you would see that the order also anticipates that the FIRS and the Nigerian Customs would come up with regulations and guidelines for how this will be implemented because you don't want to be give the incentive to the wrong people so I think the first thing to do to qualify is to be playing in that space. But there would also be some practical you know requirements from the federal Inland Revenue Service and the nigeran Customs Service. All right,  let's come to the withholding tax now I mean while it's a bit technical one of the aim of this particular one is also to you know simplify the process and make it less ambigous and all of that do you think that has been achieved looking at the document we have now as a tax practitioner. I'm a tax specialist so I've been doing this for 20 years plus it simplifies it for me right but you must appreciate that you know this is my life, there are some businesses that cannot afford consultants, for them I'm not so sure whether we have reached the level of Simplicity that's required but you know I must applaud the committee because they have dealt with some really thorning issues in relation to withholding tax one of them you know is in relation to Traders and manufacturers where they Supply their goods in the ordinary cost of business so the previous regulation says said that you know sales in the ordinary course of business was Exempted but the tax authorities because there was no definition of what constitute the ordinary cost of business, the tax authorities used to put pressure on businesses and say you must deduct withholding tax anyway otherwise you go to court you know for small medium Enterprises they're not inclined to go to court or be involved in such disputes so they pay, they're bullied into paying essentially so the committee has dealt with that issue. If you are a manufacturer your product will be 0% Exempted from withholding tax but if you're a Trader, say you're not the one manufacturing you're buying to sell then the withholding tax will be 2% and I think that's important, so withholding tax really is not a tax on its own, it's an early payment of income tax so you cannot be applying High rates of withholding tax to low margin businesses so this is why for passive income the rates are high 10% for services that are active it comes down and then if you then go down to Traders further goes down to 2% and then if you're manufacturing and selling it goes to zero and I think for me that's important because manufacturers today are under serious pressure in terms of economic headwinds they're dealing with effects they're also dealing with inflation and how much do you pass, how much of the inflation or the cost do you pass to the customers. customers do not even have the appetite or the capacity to pay for those items so their volumes are going down like you said energy and so on and so forth so a lot of them are posting losses so if you're now taking withholding tax on their supplies then they are paying taxes that are not due and I think the other thing this withholding tax regulation seeks to deal with is the issue of refund you know because it's not a final payment of tax they're supposed to take the credit notes and then recover itagainst their final income tax when they paying but if you have no tax to pay because your margins are low or eroded it then becomes very difficult to go to the tax Authority and say oh please grant me a refund because previously there was no budget for it or limited budget for it and everybody was asking from the same budget and the process was a bit opaque now what the committee has tried to do with this withholding tax order is to ensure that the refund process becomes simplified and that would provide a lot of solid to manufacturers and other players alike well there is a concern that some persons have raised with this especially when you talk about a 25 million naira threshold they are saying that the average you know uh sale price has gone up as a result of inflation and they are saying that this 25 million and you're talking about, I mean could be 50 million. What we don't do very often enough is reviewing thresholds so that threshold of 2 million naira was introduced by the finance act 2020 right. Since 2020 you know in 2020 what was the exchange rate it was probably 300 or 400 or something like that um what was the price of bread that time bread was probably 200 naira today if you want to buy bread the big Loaf it's about almost 2000 naira. so it therefore means that that threshold is not fit for purpose today but the government does not do the review of the thresholds often enough you know so as you can imagine for many small businesses 25 million naira is not a good threshold  and I have visibility of you know and that's why you raised the issue of businesses they've had to increase their prices and they cross that 25 million very easily but they are still very small businesses cottage industries you know salons you know shops and so doing 25 million 30 million and so on now if they have to be deducting withholding tax and pursuing all of this it doesn't help them. so I think what's the ideal amount for you. I think we have to work out I haven't done the calculations. We have to work out what the inflation has been since that time and come up with a new number I think it would you know be a minimum of double. I think there were a lot of opinions flying when the signed version came out but wasn't gazetted I think in less than 30 seconds, so I was very careful not to implement that for my clients why, because the substantive act actually says the minister, that there must be a writing to the taxpayers or the order must be gazetted, right now that it's been gazette and says implementation first of July 2025. I think that's what 2024 then January 2025 that's the the one that's in the apologies first January 2025 is the implementation date that's what we should hold on to the other one that says the tax authorities will come up with guidelines and go to the um Minister we don't have any insight into that um and I don't know or see the various tax authorities writing to have an inconsistent day because it would be very difficult to track you then have taxpayers that are effective 1 of July some that are later on and then some it would be so so messy and I don't think a case by case strategy by taxpayers would work because each time they go to the tax authorities they have to tax that they use the other one okay so so it's going to be too confusing so for me taxpayers just hold on to First January 2025 and Implement all right thank you so much."
"**Resources** 2. **Directory of Support Services**    - List of government agencies, NGOs, and private organizations.    - Contact information and services offered.","https://abdigital.com.ng/government-agencies-that-support-smes-in-nigeria/, https://azresearchconsult.com.ng/the-role-of-ngo-in-supporting-and-promoting-small-businesses/","The role of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the economy, and especially the economy of small firms, has grown significantly in recent years. Their function is multifarious, encompassing not only the provision of resources and expertise but also the promotion of receptive policies and the establishment of meeting places for the exchange of ideas. This paper investigates the many ways in which non-governmental organisations (NGOs) assist and promote small enterprises, focusing on their work in the areas of capacity development, policy lobbying, and innovation promotion. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are crucial in bolstering small enterprises’ capabilities. They provide courses and seminars designed to teach company owners how to run their companies efficiently. Financial management, marketing tactics, and company planning are just few of the many subjects often addressed in such courses. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) work to improve the environment for small enterprises via capacity building and policy lobbying. They advocate for laws that safeguard small businesses from unfair competition from larger firms and provide tax breaks and easier access to loans. In addition, NGOs encourage creativity among micro- and small-scale enterprises. They facilitate this by giving business owners a place to network and pick one others’ brains. They also make it easier for small enterprises to have access to cutting-edge tools and fresh approaches to running a company. To sum up, NGOs are crucial in bolstering and developing micro- and small-scale enterprises. They aid small firms greatly by increasing their potential, advocating for better policies, and encouraging creative thinking. However, there is a need for better coordination between NGOs, government agencies, and the commercial sector if their efforts are to be more successful. This will guarantee that the help given to small enterprises is thorough and appropriate. Top 10 Government Agencies that Support SMEs in Nigeria    #1.

For  Fashion designer entrepreneurs in Nigeria to be taken seriously, they need to register with: • The Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC): Registering your fashion business is crucial to building a reputable name in the fashion industry, accessing loans and gaining the trust of your customers The first step is choosing a suitable business name that reflects your brand identity and values. You can either register via CAC’s website or contact the service of a lawyer to do so on your behalf. Details of how to register with CAC can be found in the document. • Any tailor looking to evolve into ready-to-wear or mass production needs to register with the Nigerian Textile Manufacturers Association. This is one of the associations in Nigeria that interfaces with the Federal and State governments, the policymakers in the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), as well as the multinationals. When you belong to this kind of association, it gives you leverage to lead and also be visible in ready-to-wear for exports or local bidding. The Nigerian Textile Manufacturers Association requires that you pay a membership fee of ₦150,000 per year. • If you are going to play in the oil and gas sector, you need to register with the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR); Nigeria Petroleum Exchange (NIPEX), and National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS). A yearly subscription to the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) costs between ₦25,000 to ₦100,000. Without this, you cannot play in the oil and gas industry as a tailor. Some people produce polo shirts, T-shirts, coveralls, overalls, uniforms, fand lame and fire retardants; and to serve the sector, they need to be registered with these bodies. • Evidence of tax remittance to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) or the Lagos Inland Revenue Service (LIRS) will be required to service banks and other corporate entities. • Certain blue-chip companies require your PENCOM certificates to show that you pay pensions to your employees because there’s a level that some companies get to where they don’t want any of their vendors to have cases with the government or international bodies. Therefore, they want to be sure you are doing insurance not only on your equipment but on your key staff. • To provide service for the Lagos State Government, becoming a member of the Lagos State Fashion Designers Association of Nigeria (LASFADAN) is advantageous. They are recognized in the state, so joining them may give you an edge over others. You also need to register with Lagos State Public Procurement Agency (LASPPA) if you want to bid for contracts from the Lagos State government as a fashion entrepreneur. That’s also very vital. As of the time this guide was written, membership dues cost N75,000 annually. • It is also important to get licensed by the Standard Organization of Nigeria (SON) especially if you are mass-producing. SON is the sole statutory body that is vested with the responsibility of standardizing and regulating the quality of all products in Nigeria. They will visit your production site before they endorse your standards. Subscription per annum as of March 2022 is pegged at ₦100,000. You can also go for a Mandatory Conformity Assessment Programme (MANCAP) licensing. These give you an edge locally and in international exports. When your brand’s systems are verified, they’ll put the SON logo on your products. To improve in licensing, you may approach International Standards Organisation (ISO) for training for your production arm if you have one. This costs between • For exports, you should also register with Nigeria Export Promotion Council (NEPC), Industrial Training Fund (ITF), and Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF). • Some banks and some corporate bodies require your audited accounts. They want to be sure that you can deal with them because some businesses may run into hundreds of millions. Hence, they want to see your revenue and turnover to be sure that you can play in that space. • For exports, you should also register with Nigeria Export Promotion Council (NEPC), Industrial Training Fund (ITF), and Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) Setting up a Tailoring Business in Nigeria 32 ₦500,000 – ₦1,000,000 per annum. The different levels of ISO cater to different things. One has to do with your quality management system to be sure that your system and processes are error-free. For example, people in the production sector should have a Six Sigma process, whereby by the time 1,000,000 units of the same item are produced, the defect rate would be less than 0.04%. The error rate must be negligible, not that out of 1,000,000 units there’d be error rates of 10,000. No, it should be like 4 units in 1,000,000, which by implication shows that your process is so efficient that it is at par with international standards. That’s the global certification that can ensure your processes are seamless to deliver quality. • If you are into fashion training, you need a NABTEB Certification. NABTEB is the National Business and Technical Board. They are the Nigerian body that certifies artisans. Artisans sit for their examination, after which they are certified. With the NABTEB certification, an artisan may be absorbed into the workforce in foreign countries to work as a professional say in Canada, the USA, and Europe. The NABTEB certificate is very necessary for fashion entrepreneurs. The annual membership fee is ₦50,000. The Lagos State government is collaborating with the United States, African Development Foundation, and United Nations Development Programme for this purpose. Even the Nigerian Armed Forces require the NABTEB certification from tailors that desire to work with them. NABTEB is like the City and Guilds certification. The more we develop in the industry, the more the standards will be in place and certificates of tailors who make substandard clothes will be withdrawn. These registrations and licenses are mostly annual subscriptions.         - Chemical and Pharmaceutical Products.  Regulatory Approvals National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC): Register all pharmaceutical and chemical products with NAFDAC. Obtain licenses for manufacturing, importation, or distribution. Ensure Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for local production facilities. Pharmacists Council of Nigeria (PCN): Mandatory registration for pharmaceutical businesses and facilities, particularly retail and wholesale drug outlets. Secure operational permits for pharmacies. Federal Ministry of Environment: Conduct and submit an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for approval, especially for manufacturing facilities. Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON): Ensure compliance with SON’s standards for chemical and pharmaceutical products. Registration and license fees vary depending on the scope of the business (e.g., manufacturing vs. retail). For example: NAFDAC product registration: ₦100,000 to ₦300,000+ per product. PCN facility registration: ₦50,000 to ₦200,000, depending on the type of outlet.        - Plastics, Rubber, and Electrical Products.       - Other Manufacturing.      - **Electricity, Gas, Steam, and Air Conditioning Supply**.      - **Water Supply, Sewerage, Waste Management, and Remediation Activities**.

Extended Producer Responsibility policy (EPR) EPR is facilitated by NESREA, the agency of the Federal Ministry of Environment, responsible for regulating environmental standards. The EPR policy mandates producers of all kinds of items, especially packaging, to take full responsibility for buying back the packaging items they inject into the environment. The policy has a framework that informs that every packaging and production company comes under a Producer Responsibility (PR) organization. Currently, the only PR companies that are existing in the country are the ones that handle plastics. A bulk of the plastic recyclers go for the ones handling food and beverage, which is called Food and Beverage Recycling Alliance (FBRA). It is not that plastics are not found in the battery and electronic sectors, but the bulk of packaging that comes under the plastic spectrum is one that the producer responsibility organization under FBRA covers. They came into existence in 2018. They have been trying to support activities around plastic collection.   Associations  1.

Whether you’re opting for a sole proprietorship, partnership, or limited liability company, this decision will have legal implications for your business.  Next, register your business name and structure with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), which will provide you with a certificate of incorporation. Don’t overlook taxes.  Register your business with the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to secure a tax identification number (TIN). State and local authorities also require registration for business permits or licences. Ensure you’re fully compliant.  The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) and the Vehicle Inspection Office (VIO) are other vital entities to register your vehicles and drivers with. They’ll provide a vehicle licence, driver’s licence, and roadworthiness certificate.  https://nvis.frsc.gov.ng/VehicleManagement/RegisterVehicle  Finally, consider registering with pertinent transport associations and unions for a membership card or sticker.  Types of Licenses and Permits The licenses and permits required for a transport business in Nigeria vary, but here are some key ones:  State Transport Authorities (STA) License: This regulatory licence is for intra-state transport operators. An example is the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA). National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) Permit: A union permit for road transport operators. Lagos State Drivers’ Institute (LASDRI) Card: A training and certification card for drivers in Lagos State.    Steps to Registering  an Inland Waterway Transport Business in Nigeria  Registration of Shipping Company and Ships It is important to seek legal advice while undertaking registration of a shipping company. This is because regulations and requirements vary based on the type of shipping company and several other factors. However, registration of a shipping company will generally necessitate the following actions: 1. Business Name Registration: It is important to register a business name in Nigeria to avoid losing a desired name to competitors and also ensure regulatory compliance as one cannot carry out a business without registration of same.[i] A business name can be registered as a sole proprietorship or partnership.[ii] Where the prospective shipping company is a jointly owned business not bearing partners' true names, is an individual-owned business not reflecting the owner's true name, or has a business name that differs from its corporate name, then it is mandated that it business name be registered before starting a business. To register a business, first, check for the availability of the desired name on the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) application portal. If approved, the CAC reserves the name for 60 days, within which you must then complete online forms with business details like nature, address, and owner information. Next, filing fees must be paid to the CAC using the Remita platform on the Company Registration Portal (CPR). Lastly, upload the required documents including passport photograph, signature, and valid identification card of the owner/partner. Once a Business Name is approved, it is entered into the CAC Register and a registration certificate is issued, including a unique Business Name Number.[iii] This certificate must be prominently displayed at the principal place of business. 2. Company Incorporation: Once you have registered your business name, you can then incorporate the company with the CAC by submitting required documents like the Memorandum and Articles of Association, and fulfilling other requirements, in compliance with the provisions of the provisions of the law.  3. Registration of Shipping Company: To qualify for a shipping license, a company must primarily engage in shipping and provide a completed NIMASA Form 1, tax clearance certificate, certified copies of Form CAC 7, Certificate of Incorporation, and Memorandum and Article of Association with a minimum share capital of N25 million dedicated to shipping. Also, the company is required to submit its latest audited report, CAC Form 2.1 if applicable, evidence of annual returns filing, registration as a Licensed Customs Agent, joint venture agreement if applicable, charter party agreement if applicable, and a bank reference. The procedure for registration is that the shipping company or its agent submits its application to the General Manager of either the Western or Eastern Ports. Upon submission, a debit note will be received to pay 200,000. After payment confirmation, the Nigerian Port Authority (NPA) issues a receipt. Subsequently, the NPA provides the original Certificate of Registration. The registration license is then issued within two weeks, contingent upon the company providing all required documents as listed  https://nimasa.gov.ng/services/ship-registration/bove. 4. Fulfilment of Tax Obligations: It is important to obtain Tax clearance and a Tax Identification Number (TIN) from the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) before starting operations. Importantly, regardless of registration status, taxation obligations cannot be overlooked. 5. Compliance with NIMASA Regulations: It is also important to take steps to ensure compliance with the maritime safety and security regulations set by the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA). Such regulations include the Merchant Shipping (Manning) Regulations 2010, the Safe Man Hours Work and Watch Keep Regulations 2010, and other directives of NIMASA. 6. Marking of Ships: Another action to take while setting up your shipping company is to permanently mark the ships as follows: the ship’s name on both bows and the stem, along with the port of registry; the official number and registered tonnage on the main beam; and the ship’s draught of water scale on each side of the stem and stem post.[v] These markings must be maintained without alteration, except for necessary changes where lawfully provided. Failure to keep the ship properly marked or tampering with the markings, except under specific circumstances, is an offence. 7. Registration of Ships: There is an obligation to register any ship owned wholly by persons qualified to own a registered Nigerian ship, except where such is exempted.[vi] To register a ship in Nigeria, a formal written application must be submitted to the Registrar at a Nigerian port of registry in an approved format. The application, whether from an individual or a corporation, must include the necessary information and documentation such as the purchaser's details, evidence of their ability to operate the vessel, ownership shares, bill of sale for previously registered ships, ship's log-book, proof of financial resources, and the corporation's certificate of incorporation and Articles of Association. If an agent is involved, their authority must be documented accordingly.  Article 91 of UNCLOS 111(1982) requires every state to issue ships which it has granted the rights to fly its flag a document to that effect which is known as the “certificate of registry”. The Nigerian Ship Registration Office (NSRO) is empowered to register ships in accordance with the following Acts: I. Merchant Shipping Act. S. 5-81 (part ii & iii)  II. NIMASA Act 2007 S. 28-32 (part viii) III. Coastal and Inland Shipping Act S. 22-28 (part v) Types of Ship Registration Provisional Registration: Flag Registration Bareboat Registration (Flag/Cabotage) Cabotage Registration (Wholly Nigerian Owned, Joint Venture, Foreign Category) Registers Maintained by the Nigerian Ship Registry Register for merchant ships. Register for fishing vessels. Register for ships under construction. Register for ship under the bareboat charter and other charters exceeding 12 months Register of licensed ships below 15 gross tons. Register for Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) and Floating Storage and Offloading (FSO). Special Cabotage Register for Wholly Nigerian Owned Vessels. Special Cabotage Register for Bareboat Chartered Vessels. Special Cabotage Register for Foreign-Owned Vessels Register of Boats with Engine of 200 Horse-Power and Above. 8. Licensing and Permit: Another important step is to secure the required licenses and permits from relevant authorities, such as NIMASA and the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA). 9. Compliance with Local Content Requirements: Lastly, it is important to take steps to adhere to any applicable local content requirements, which refer to regulations mandating a certain percentage of goods, services, or personnel to be sourced locally. MINIMUM SHARE CAPITAL FOR VESSEL OWNERS (COMPANIES ONLY)  The minimum share capital for any vessel owned by a Nigerian company is N25,000,000.00 RESERVATION AND APPROVAL OF SHIP NAMES The Application for Registration allows an owner to specify a preferred name for a ship and any alternatives, should the preferred name be unavailable. It is also possible to check on name availability before submitting the application and to reserve preferred names. This can be done by visiting the Nigerian Ship Registration Office. A proposed name may be refused for any of the following reasons: It is already the name of a Nigerian registered ship It is a name so similar to an existing name that it could pass off as belonging to the same owner. It is likely to cause offence or embarrassment to the flag. It is calculated to deceive or offend the public interest. Reservation of name is for a 60 days period after which the name shall lapse.
