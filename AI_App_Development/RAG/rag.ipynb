It is on this premise that several efforts are geared towards consciously providing the enabling environment for the MSMEs to thrive. This sub-sector needs special attention by the Government because the operatives are largely informal and financially very weak and at the same time they need to develop for the national economy to grow. The EBS 2012 shows that significant differences exist between formal enterprises and informal businesses in the areas of higher average staffing and a higher growth of staffing since business establishment. As in many developing countries, MSMEs in Nigeria have not achieved their full potential as a result of some critical inhibiting factors. These factors, which can be classified into internal and external, include among others:  Internal factors 1. Aversion to joint ownership 2. Family ties, i.e. bringing family into business. 3. Financial mismanagement 4. Lack of basic business capacity (knowledge, skills & attitude) 5. Non-recruitment of qualified personnel 6. Lack of perseverance and staying power when the business is going through tough times. 7. Poor record keeping especially accounting books 8. Lack of standardization of products 9. Being the all-in-all, i.e. managing director, accountant, cashier, admin. Manager, etc. 10. Low capacity to invest in R&D, ICT & E-commerce   11. Inadequate linkage to local & international supply chains 12. Limited access to markets. 13. Lack of exit/succession plan. 14. Declining business etiquette & disregard for contract sanctities.   External factors 1. Poor state of infrastructure 2. Weak access to production inputs (such as finance, workspace) & product markets etc. 3. Multiplicity of Taxes and levies plus red tape 4. Low access to information 5. Unfair competition with dumped products substitutes.  Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) play a crucial role in Nigeria’s economy, driving innovation, job creation, and economic growth. However, these SMEs face numerous challenges that hinder their progress and sustainability. We will explore the key challenges faced by SMEs in Nigeria today and provide practical solutions to help overcome them. 1. Limited Access to Finance Access to affordable finance remains a significant hurdle for SMEs in Nigeria. High-interest rates, stringent collateral requirements, and limited credit history make it difficult for these businesses to secure the funds they need to grow and expand.  2. Infrastructure Development Inadequate infrastructure, including unstable power supply, poor road networks, and limited technology access, hampers the productivity and efficiency of SMEs, leading to increased costs and operational challenges.  3. Limited Market Access and Competition SMEs often struggle to penetrate existing markets due to fierce competition from larger firms and a lack of market information. They need help accessing export markets and expanding beyond their local boundaries. 4. Inadequate Skills and Capacity The unavailability of skilled labor, including technical expertise, management capabilities, and entrepreneurial skills, poses a significant challenge for SMEs in Nigeria. The lack of a skilled workforce can hamper growth and innovation.  5. Regulatory and Administrative Burdens Complex regulatory frameworks, excessive bureaucracy, and corruption create barriers for SMEs in Nigeria. Cumbersome business registration processes, obtaining permits, and complying with tax regulations add to the administrative burden faced by SMEs.  ISSUES AND CHALLENGES It is undeniable that MSMEs are critical to employment generation and economic growth in Nigeria. The Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) has consistently strived to fulfill its responsibilities as outlined in the relevant legislation through cooperative efforts and partnerships. Nevertheless, various obstacles continue to impede its endeavors. Primarily, a thorough examination of the governing legislation elucidates that the primary purpose is to foster the promotion and growth of MSMEs, without extending to regulatory or supervisory functions. This presents a significant challenge, particularly considering the coexistence of MSMEs within both formal and informal sectors of the economy. What is more appalling is the growing number of businesses in the informal sector despite continuous efforts by the CAC as well as other stakeholders to ensure that businesses get registered in the country. The fact then remains that MSMEs in the informal sector are without any form of control or regulation, and this can have a ripple effect on the economy. An unregulated business environment results in stunted economic growth, lower standards, and ultimately market failure. At the same time, while SMEDAN’s mandate encompasses MSMEs broadly, its lack of regulatory authority leaves a substantial segment of the economy unregulated by statutory frameworks. Furthermore, an assessment of the operations of MSMEs and their attendant challenges in the Nigerian clime is critical evidence of the effectiveness of SMEDAN. Despite the agency’s developmental efforts over the years, MSMEs continue to face challenges such as insufficient entrepreneurial experience, poor funding, and under-capitalization, inadequate infrastructural facilities, poor record keeping by small business owners/managers, insecurity in parts of the country, inadequate credit control/loan default, poor time management, high investment in luxury assets, poor macro-economic conditions. These invariable casts a shadow on the effectiveness of the Agency’s training and developmental activities. Another impediment is the limited awareness of SMEDAN’s activities within the formal and informal sectors. As a result of this, only a fraction of MSMEs have access to the benefits offered by the Agency and this defeats the purpose of its establishment. If the Nigerian economy is to witness a radical reform through MSMEs then the Agency’s activities and services need to be more pronounced among them. Moreover, bureaucratic obstacles often prevent MSMEs from using SMEDAN’s support services. This is due to red-tapism, protracted and onerous administrative processes, and prolonged application processing times which can deter them from requesting support from the organization.  Empowering Nigeria’s Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs): Overcoming Challenges for Economic Prosperity Over time, Nigeria’s economy has significantly relied upon the oil and agricultural sectors as its primary pillars of growth and development. However, a notable paradigm shift has been observed as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have emerged as pivotal drivers of economic expansion within the country. These SMEs are critical in Nigeria’s economic landscape, contributing substantially to employment generation and gross domestic product (GDP).   According to the Nigerian Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency (SMEDAN), SMEs in Nigeria account for more than 50% of industrial employment and contribute approximately 48% to the country’s GDP. This remarkable contribution has not only propelled economic growth but has also garnered international recognition, showcasing the immense potential of Nigeria’s SME sector in fostering progress and advancement.   The contributions of SMEs encompass a wide array of aspects, including but not limited to job creation, economic diversification, local economic development, innovation, entrepreneurship, and poverty eradication. Despite their significant contributions, SMEs in Nigeria face a myriad of challenges, collectively referred to as the “Nigerian Factor.”   The term “Nigerian Factor” refers to the challenges and hindrances within Nigeria’s business environment that can impede the expansion and success of small and medium-sized enterprises. This article explores these challenges and discusses potential solutions to empower SMEs and cultivate a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem in Nigeria. The Challenges:   Limited Access to Financing: One of the predominant hurdles faced by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria revolves around the challenge of accessing viable financing options. According to the World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys for Nigeria, access to finance consistently emerges as a paramount business constraint. In the 2019 survey, 48% of Nigerian firms identified access to finance as a significant constraint, underscoring the pervasive nature of this issue. Despite numerous financial institutions in the country, SMEs often find themselves compelled to self-fund for various compelling reasons. These encompass onerous collateral prerequisites, excessively high interest rates, and the absence of an established credit history, impeding their capacity to secure loans.   To confront this pressing challenge, it is imperative that innovative financing avenues, such as Venture capital funds, angel investors, and microfinance organisations, furnish SMEs with specialised financial solutions tailored to their unique requirements. These alternatives offer the necessary support and flexibility that conventional lenders cannot provide, especially for SMEs with high-growth potential.   Furthermore, the government can play a pivotal role in redressing this issue by instating financial initiatives to furnish SMEs with favourable loan terms. Such initiatives empower SMEs to access the required funds more advantageously, enabling them to expand and prosper. Additionally, bolstering financial literacy among SME proprietors and entrepreneurs can substantially contribute to their proficiency in navigating the intricate financing terrain, comprehending loan conditions, and effectively managing their credit. This can be achieved through targeted training programs and workshops.   Inadequate Infrastructure: Nigeria faces significant infrastructure hurdles, including recurrent power interruptions, inadequate transportation systems, and limited access to reliable internet services. The World Bank’s annual Doing Business report consistently underscores these challenges. In the 2021 report, Nigeria ranked 171st out of 190 countries in the “Getting Electricity” category, indicating significant difficulties in securing dependable power. These obstacles place considerable financial burdens on businesses and hinder the smooth operations of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), constraining their long-term growth potential.   To tackle these issues, the government must prioritise infrastructure development, especially in areas densely populated with SMEs. This entails substantial investments in power generation and distribution systems to mitigate frequent outages, collaborating with a telecommunications company to expand broadband infrastructure for enhanced nationwide internet connectivity, and facilitating the effective use of digital tools and platforms for business operations, communication, and online market access. Additionally, enhancing transportation networks, encompassing roads, ports, and logistics infrastructure, will bolster connectivity and reduce transportation expenses for SMEs.   The government can also create a supportive environment conducive to SME growth by leveraging the potential of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure projects. This approach will alleviate the strain on public finances, ensuring efficient project implementation. Consequently, it will attract investments, foster entrepreneurial ventures, and stimulate economic growth, benefiting SMEs and the broader economy.   Exchange Rate Volatility: Nigeria’s recent adoption of rate unification or floating rate policies has substantially impacted small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), especially considering the country’s dependence on imports. The consequences of this policy on businesses will be contingent on various factors. However, the volatility in exchange rates can pose challenges for SMEs in terms of planning, budgeting, and handling their exposure to foreign exchange.   Research from the International Journal of Economics, Commerce, and Management (IJECM) underscores the significance of government involvement in aiding SMEs in dealing with currency risks. Providing access to hedging tools and implementing financial education programs can bolster SMEs’ capacity to withstand fluctuations in exchange rates (Reference: IJECM, Vol. 7, No. 2, February 2019).   SMEs can employ risk management techniques like hedging to mitigate potential currency risks. Hedging involves using financial instruments or methods to protect against unfavourable shifts in exchange rates. By implementing hedging strategies, SMEs can proficiently handle their exposure to currency fluctuations and decrease the potential adverse impact on their operations. Additionally, SMEs should closely monitor exchange rate dynamics, stay well-informed about market conditions, and seek expert guidance to determine the most suitable risk management strategies for their specific circumstances. This approach will enable them to make well-informed decisions regarding their exposure to foreign exchange.   Lack of Technological Adoption: A study by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in Nigeria indicated that a significant portion of SMEs in the country still operate with minimal or no technological integration in their business processes. This study highlighted that only a small percentage of SMEs had adopted modern technologies.   In Nigeria, adopting contemporary technology is paramount for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to enhance their competitiveness in the global market and achieve scalability.   However, many SMEs in the country still rely on outdated practices, significantly limiting their growth potential. To effectively address this issue and foster a conducive environment for technological advancement, the government must implement comprehensive measures that support the development of digital infrastructure and encourage SMEs to embrace technology, which can be done by providing robust training programs tailored to their specific needs. The World Bank, in its report on global competitiveness, has emphasised the crucial role of technology adoption for SMEs to stay competitive and thrive in today’s rapidly evolving business landscape.   These programs should offer comprehensive training and capacity-building initiatives to equip SME owners and employees with the necessary skills and knowledge to leverage contemporary technologies effectively. By enhancing their digital literacy and technical expertise, SMEs can overcome barriers and confidently embrace innovative tools and practices.   Inadequate Business Support Services: To effectively address the challenge of insufficient business support services for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), it is highly recommended that the government establish a supportive ecosystem. This can be achieved by establishing business development centres and incubation hubs nationwide. These centres would serve as knowledge hubs, providing SMEs with vital resources, mentoring, training programs, and access to market data. Furthermore, establishing such centres is intended to foster the growth, sustainability, and overall success of SMEs in the country.   Policy Inconsistencies and Regulatory Burdens: Policy inconsistencies and regulatory burdens for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria have been longstanding challenges that hinder the growth and development of this crucial sector. Here are some of the key aspects contributing to the problem:   – Frequent Policy Changes: SMEs in Nigeria often face challenges due to the frequent changes in policies and regulations. These sudden and unpredictable changes make it difficult for businesses to plan and invest long-term.   – Lack of Coordination: There is often a lack of coordination and coherence among various government agencies responsible for regulating SMEs. This leads to confusion and inefficiencies in compliance, as businesses may receive conflicting information from different sources.   – Complex Registration and Licensing Procedures: Registering and obtaining licenses for SMEs can be complex and time-consuming. This can discourage potential entrepreneurs and lead to a significant portion of the informal economy.   – Taxation and Multiple Levies: SMEs often face challenges related to taxation. There are multiple levels of taxation, including federal, state, and local government levies. The complexity and sometimes arbitrary nature of these taxes can significantly burden SMEs.   – Inconsistent Enforcement of Regulations: Even when regulations exist, enforcement can be inconsistent. This can lead to unfair competition and a lack of a level playing field for SMEs.   A comprehensive analysis conducted by the World Bank Group under the title “Doing Business 2020: Comparing Business Regulation in 190 Economies” underscores the profound impact of regulatory conditions on SMEs. It highlights the critical necessity of streamlining administrative procedures and simplifying regulatory frameworks to promote and support business development.   To promote the growth of SMEs, it is essential to streamline administrative processes, simplify regulatory frameworks, and establish policy consistency. By undertaking these measures, a more favourable business environment can be created, fostering the development and success of SMEs.   Corruption: Nigeria grapples with persistent corruption issues, with far-reaching consequences for its small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The World Bank conducts rigorous Enterprise Surveys to evaluate the business landscape across different nations, Nigeria included. These assessments consistently spotlight corruption-related hurdles SMEs encounter, such as irregular payments and bribery. Corruption takes on various forms, including bribery and extortion, creating significant barriers for SMEs when navigating official procedures, obtaining necessary permits, and accessing crucial resources. Furthermore, corruption erodes trust and confidence in the commercial sphere, making it increasingly challenging for SMEs to secure investments and establish valuable partnerships. Effectively tackling corruption is crucial for establishing a just and transparent business environment that nurtures the growth and prosperity of SMEs in Nigeria.   In summary, by empowering Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria and strategically resolving pertinent challenges, the nation stands poised to unleash the untapped potential within its SME sector. This, in turn, will catalyse a sustained surge in economic growth and overall development for the country.'),\n",

Their function is multifarious, encompassing not only the provision of resources and expertise but also the promotion of receptive policies and the establishment of meeting places for the exchange of ideas. This paper investigates the many ways in which non-governmental organisations (NGOs) assist and promote small enterprises, focusing on their work in the areas of capacity development, policy lobbying, and innovation promotion. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are crucial in bolstering small enterprises’ capabilities. They provide courses and seminars designed to teach company owners how to run their companies efficiently. Financial management, marketing tactics, and company planning are just few of the many subjects often addressed in such courses. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) work to improve the environment for small enterprises via capacity building and policy lobbying. They advocate for laws that safeguard small businesses from unfair competition from larger firms and provide tax breaks and easier access to loans. In addition, NGOs encourage creativity among micro- and small-scale enterprises. They facilitate this by giving business owners a place to network and pick one others’ brains. They also make it easier for small enterprises to have access to cutting-edge tools and fresh approaches to running a company. To sum up, NGOs are crucial in bolstering and developing micro- and small-scale enterprises. They aid small firms greatly by increasing their potential, advocating for better policies, and encouraging creative thinking. However, there is a need for better coordination between NGOs, government agencies, and the commercial sector if their efforts are to be more successful. This will guarantee that the help given to small enterprises is thorough and appropriate. Top 10 Government Agencies that Support SMEs in Nigeria    #1.

The National Economic Reconstruction Fund The National Economic Reconstruction Fund (NERFUND) was set up to serve as a medium to long-term financing to viable Small and Medium Scale Production Enterprises in Nigeria. The grand objectives of NERFUND were to increase the quantum of goods and services available for local consumption and export; to provide the needed employment and expand Nigeria’s production base with added value to the economy.  However, only the most viable projects may benefit from the NERFUND loans programme. The ultimate aim is to re-orientate the nation towards a production culture from the old trading culture. Thus, the National Economic Reconstruction Fund was established by Decree No. 2 of 1989 to act as a catalyst towards the stimulation of the rapid rise of real production enterprises in the country.  The agency was mandated to provide long/medium term loans to entrepreneurs through commercial/merchant banks for industrial growth of Nigeria.

The CBN commenced operations on July 1, 1959.  The major regulatory objectives of the apex bank are to maintain the external reserves of the country, to promote monetary stability, and to act as a banker of last resort and financial adviser to the federal government.  Nevertheless, the bank had become involved in lending directly to consumers, contravening its original intention to work through commercial banks in activities involving consumer lending. Also, the Nigerian government through the central bank has been actively involved in building the nation’s money and equity centers, forming securities regulatory boards and introducing treasury bills and instruments into the Nigeria capital market.  In addition to its core functions, the Central Bank of Nigeria has over the years performed some major developmental functions; focused on all the key sectors of the Nigerian economy – such as oil and gas, telecommunication, financial, agricultural and industrial sectors. The CBN in recognition of the role of SMEs in the economic development of Nigeria; has instructed all commercial banks in Nigeria to set aside certain percentage of their earnings for the funding of the small and medium sized business sector.

Federal Institute of Industrial Research Oshodi The Federal Institute of Industrial Research Oshodi (FIIRO) is a government parastatal under the Federal Ministry of Science and Technology. The organization was the idea of an economic mission sent to Nigeria in 1953 by the World Bank; due mainly to the fact that industrial research activities in Nigeria were diffused and uncoordinated. The FIIRO projects, resources, publications and training workshops are actively identified and achieved through its research and development (R&D) pursuits.  FIIRO was setup in 1956 as Nigeria’s foremost market research agency with the mandate of accelerating industrialization in Nigeria; and has over the years developed technologies that have promoted the ideals of entrepreneurship development in Nigeria. The institute has locally sourced alternative raw materials for industries, adequate food processing techniques, improved nutritional contents, and locally fabricated machines, equipment and many more in its archives.

Raw Materials Research and Development Council The Raw Materials Research and Development Council (RMRDC) is an agency of the Federal Government of Nigeria vested with the mandate to promote the development and utilization of Nigeria’s industrial raw materials. It originated from the recommendations of a Workshop on Industrial Matters, organized by the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) and the Nigerian Institute of Social and Economic Research (NISER) in July 1983.  The organization was established by Decree (Now Act) No.39 of 1987, but commenced operation on February 10, 1988. It is today, Nigeria’s focal point for the development and utilization of the nation’s vast industrial raw material. The Raw Materials Research and Development Council (RMRDC) was established at a time when dwindling foreign exchange earnings from petroleum was expended to importing raw materials and products which were available or could be competitively produced in Nigeria.  It is important to note that RMRDC provides opportunities for hands-on entrepreneurship skill acquisition in diverse resource-based investment areas of the 10 industrial sectors of Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) namely: Food, beverage and tobacco; textile and wearing apparel; leather and leather products; wood and wood products; chemicals, pharmaceuticals and plastics, rubber; motor vehicle and miscellaneous; electrical and electronics; pulp and paper; as well as new and advanced materials; promoting value addition to our abundant natural resources.

The Corporate Affairs Commission No legal business or corporate organization can undermined the place of the Nigeria Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) in its contributive efforts to the Easy of Doing Business in Nigeria through company registration. The Corporate Affairs Commission of Nigeria was established in 1990 by the Companies and Allied Matters Act No 1 (CAMA) 1990, now on Act cap C20 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria.  The establishment of the Commission as an autonomous body was as a result of the perceived inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the erstwhile Company Registry, a department under the Federal Ministry of Commerce and Tourism which was then responsible for the registration and administration of the repealed Companies Act of 1968. The CAC is therefore charged with the responsibility among others to regulate the formation, management and winding up of companies in Nigeria.  It carry out its functions through accredited members of Association of National Accountants of Nigeria, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria, Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators of Nigeria (ICSAN) the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), among others.

Definition and Importance of MSMEs**    - Definitions according to Nigerian policies (e.g., SMEDAN criteria).    - Role of MSMEs in Nigeria\\'s economy (employment, GDP contribution, innovation). DEFINITION OF MSMEs IN NIGERIA  From the point of view of national policy, enterprises may be classified by size, sector, organisation, staff strength, technology and location. These variables interact with each other in complex ways which must be taken into cognisance to understand the nature, characteristics, performance, problems and challenges of business enterprises. From the perspective of policy and planning, size provides the most practical basis for classification.  The usual criteria include one or more of the following: employment, turnover, assets, and paid-up capital. However, definitions vary from country to country relative to the overall size and structure of the domestic economy. For the purpose of a coherent national policy, it is necessary to establish a standard definition in order to provide a common object of reference by stakeholders. Based on the assessment of existing national perspectives on the classification of MSMEs, the National Policy on MSMEs adopts a classification based on dual criteria: employment and assets (excluding land and buildings), as follows: Classification adopted by the National Policy on MSMEs: Micro enterprises have an employee size of less than 10 and assets (excluding land and buildings) of less than 10 million naira. Small enterprises have an employee size of 10-49 and assets (excluding land and buildings) of over 10 million naira but less than 100 million naira. Medium enterprises have an employee size of 50-199 and assets (excluding land and buildings) worth more than 100 million naira but less than 1 billion naira.  Where there exists a conflict in classification between employment and assets criteria (for example, if an enterprise has assets worth twelve million naira (N12m) but employs 7 persons), the employment-based classification will take precedence and the enterprise would be regarded as micro. Employment-based classification tends to provide a relatively more stable definition, given that inflationary trends frequently compromise the asset-based definition. In choosing these new definitions, cognisance was taken of all possible factors, including international comparisons and peculiarities of the various sub-sectors/enterprises. MSME definition by: SMEDAN Micro Enterprise: Employees <10, Asset Base <N5 Million Small Enterprise: Employees >10 but <50, Asset Base >N5 but <50 Million Medium Enterprise: Employees >50 but <200, Asset Base >N50 but <500 Million  BoI Micro Enterprise: Employees 1 to 10; Turnover <N20 Million; Asset Base <N5 Million Small Enterprise: Employees >11 to 50; Turnover >N20 to <N100 Million; Asset Base >N5 to N50 Million Medium Enterprise: Employees >51 to 200; Turnover >N100 to <N500 Million; Asset Base: >N50 to N500 Million  CBN Micro Enterprise: *Employees <11; Asset Base <N5 Million Small Enterprise: Employees 11 to 300; Asset Base N5 to <500 Million Medium Enterprise: Employees 11 to 300; Asset Base N5 to <500 Million  Based on the various definitions above, MSMEs are broadly defined as enterprises with a labour force between 1-300 people, annual turnover less than N500 million and an asset base no more than N500 million.  CHARACTERISTICS AND PERFORMANCE OF MSMEs IN NIGERIA  MSMEs cover the entire range of economic activity sectors in Nigeria. There are a number of challenges that currently stifle MSMEs in the country and some of these challenges are consistent across the varying types of MSMEs. These include low market access, poor access to credit, poor information flow, discriminatory legislation, poor access to land, weak linkage among different segments of the operations in the sector, weak operating capacities in terms of skills, technology, knowledge and attitudes, as well as lack of infrastructure. There are also weak safeguards against occupational health and environmental hazards.  However, each of the three categories of MSMEs has its own peculiar characteristics and problems, requiring targeted policies to address them.  Micro Enterprises  Micro Enterprises employ between 1 and 9 persons. The 2013 National MSME collaborative survey put the estimated number of micro enterprises at 36.99 million with a minimum total employment of 57.84 million. This group is dominated by those who engage in wholesale & retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and household goods which accounts for about 54.67% followed by manufacturing (13.21%). Other numerically significant sectors include agriculture (8.92%), other services (7.80%), accommodation and food services (5.51%), transport & storage (4.76%) and arts, entertainment & recreation (1.06%).  The typical micro enterprise is operated by a sole proprietor/manager aided mainly by unpaid family workers and the occasional paid employee and apprentice. Output value is very low. The levels of technology and skills are also very low. However, with the entry of many unemployed school leavers, including secondary school leavers and graduate of tertiary institutions, there is much scope for upgrading technology and skills set for existing enterprises and for the rise of new technology-based enterprises. Funding is mainly from individual resources, with a little help from family and traditional mutual fund societies (esusu). Government interacts very little with individual micro enterprises, except through the occasional cooperative or other officially recognised groups. According to the Enterprise Baseline Survey 2012 (EBS) conducted by GIZ and SMEDAN, the propensity of formal micro enterprises to invest is 88% compared with only 16% of informal micro businesses. Bank loans are rarely sought and very rarely obtained. Micro enterprises have two strong points in their favour. They are numerous and ubiquitous and grow in numbers but have little propensity to grow internally and further develop their business. Even a small improvement in their productivity and output would result in large improvements in employment, income and productivity in every nook and corner of the country, but dealing with them requires sensitivity, empathy and a community-focused approach.  Small Enterprises  Small enterprises (with employment from 10 - 49 persons) cover much the same spectrum of enterprise types but are concentrated in the more modern, more sophisticated end. The 2013 National MSMEs Survey put the number of small enterprises in Nigeria at 68,168. While most of them are sole proprietorships, a significant number are incorporated businesses. This segment has a large reservoir of educated manpower and technical skills, as well as relatively improved access to the banks. They employ approximately 1.86 million people according to the 2013 collaborative survey. According to the EBS 2012, 89% of formal small enterprises plan to invest whereas only 19% of informal small businesses plan to invest. It has the highest potential for growth through nurturing, capacity building and support. Organisationally, they are well represented by professional and trade associations. Medium Enterprises  Medium enterprises are the formal face of Nigerian enterprises employing between 50 and 199 persons. The 2013 National MSMEs Survey put the number of medium enterprises in Nigeria at 4,670. Concentrated in a few sectors, notably manufacturing, transportation, information and communication technology, agro & agro-allied and oil & gas, they are fairly well organised and well connected. They have fairly good access to government and the financial system. Few in number and restricted in scope, they represent the popular Missing Middle\" of Nigeria\\'s private enterprise system.\"'),\n",

      "Taxes for small businesses in Nigeria are usually not paid enough attention. Many small businesses either forget or purposely skip tax payments in their budgets.  Taxes are what businesses pay the government for operating. Whether you run a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, or corporation, you must follow your country’s tax rules. Taxes fund federal, state, and local government activities, so if your business is registered, a portion of your profits goes to the government.  Understanding Taxes in Nigeria All employees, business owners, non-residents earning income in Nigeria, and companies operating there must pay taxes. Federal, state, and local governments manage Nigeria’s tax system.  Federal Taxes: Companies Income Tax (CIT), Value Added Tax (VAT), capital gains tax, stamp duty, education tax, petroleum profit tax, etc. State Taxes: Personal Income Tax, Business Premises Tax, development levy, etc. Local Taxes: Various levies and rates. Types of Tax for Small Businesses in Nigeria Navigating the world of taxes as a small business owner in Nigeria can be tricky. The types of tax obligations you require depend on factors like location, type, size, and business revenue.   In this section, we’ll break down some of the most common taxes you might encounter.  1. Company Income Tax (CIT) Company Income Tax is charged on the profits of limited liability companies by the Nigerian government.  File your annual CIT returns and pay the tax within six months of your financial year-end to avoid fines. Late payments attract a penalty of 25,000 Naira for the first month and 5,000 Naira for each subsequent month.  2. Personal Income Tax (PIT) Personal Income Tax is levied on the income of individuals living in Nigeria. As a business owner, you must pay PIT on your business profits.  PIT rates range from 7% to 24%, depending on your income bracket.  If you have employees, deduct PAYE (Pay As You Earn) from their salaries and remit it to the tax authorities by the 10th of each month.  3. Value Added Tax (VAT) Value Added Tax, or VAT, is a consumption tax on goods and services sold to the public. Registered businesses must collect VAT on sales and remit it to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) monthly. The VAT rate is 7.5%, though some items, like basic food, medical products, books, and agricultural products, are exempt. Failing to pay VAT can result in a 5% per annum penalty plus interest. Not registering for VAT incurs a 10,000 Naira penalty for the first month and 5,000 Naira for each following month.   4. Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Capital Gains Tax applies to profits from selling capital assets like land, buildings, stocks, and shares. The CGT rate in Nigeria is 10%, payable by the seller of the asset.  5. Business Premises Tax (BPT) State governments levy Business Premises Tax on properties used for business, such as offices, factories, and shops. Rates vary by state and property location.  6. Customs Duties Customs duties are taxes on imported goods, with rates ranging from 5% to 35%, depending on the type of goods.  7. Stamp Duty Tax Stamp duty is imposed on the transfer of legal documents, including homes, buildings, copyrights, land, patents, and securities. Documents must be stamped within 40 days of execution. Stamp duty amounts vary: some have fixed rates, while others are ad valorem, meaning the duty increases with the transaction value.  Calculating and Paying Taxes for Small Businesses in Nigeria First, identify the taxes your business must pay. Each tax has its rates, and your annual revenue determines the amount you owe.  Penalties for Non-Compliance For example, Company Income Tax must be paid within six months after the fiscal year or 18 months from incorporation for new businesses. Failure to file means a N25,000 penalty for the first month and N5,000 for each following month, plus interest.  Tax Requirements for Nigerian Businesses Documents you typically need include:  Tax Identification Number (TIN): Issued when registering with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). Audited Financial Statement: A yearly overview of your business’s finances, prepared according to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Self-Assessment Form: Declares your estimated tax liability. Additional documents may be needed depending on the specific tax.  How to Pay Tax as a Small Business in Nigeria Paying taxes involves several steps, but it’s manageable:  Step 1: Register Your Business Register with the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and your state’s tax authority. Visit their office or website and complete the necessary forms with your business details.  Step 2: Identify Applicable Taxes Determine which taxes apply to your business based on factors like location and type. Monitor your expenses and profits to calculate your taxable income and review financial statements for deductions and allowances.  Step 3: Fill Out a Self-Assessment Form This form estimates your tax for the year. Get the form from the tax authority’s office or website, and carefully provide details about your business, income, and tax amount due.  Step 4: File Your Tax Returns Gather essential documents like your annual financial statement, CAC documents, directors’ statements, and the completed self-assessment form. File returns via the FIRS or the appropriate state tax authority’s online portal.  Step 5: Pay Your Tax Pay at a bank or through the tax authority’s website. Keep your TIN and other tax documents handy during payment.  Step 6: Keep Thorough Records Save receipts, financial statements, and tax returns for at least six years. These records are vital for audits and proving compliance to stakeholders like investors, lenders, customers, or suppliers.

Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of Nigeria’s economy, driving innovation, creating jobs, and contributing significantly to economic growth. Recognizing the vital role played by SMEs, the Nigeria Finance Act of 2019 introduces a range of tax incentives to support their development and foster a conducive business environment. As a leading accounting firm in Nigeria, we explore the tax incentives provided under the Nigeria Finance Act 2019 and their potential impact on SMEs. 1. Value Added Tax (VAT) Exemption Threshold: The Finance Act 2019 raises the VAT exemption threshold for SMEs, providing significant relief for businesses with an annual turnover of 25 million Naira or less. SMEs falling within this threshold are now exempt from registering for and charging VAT on their goods and services. This measure aims to ease the administrative burden for smaller businesses and stimulate growth in the sector. Implication: The VAT exemption threshold allows SMEs to retain a larger portion of their revenue, enhancing their competitiveness and financial sustainability. It encourages growth and investment in SMEs, contributing to job creation and economic development. 2. Export Expansion Grant (EEG) Scheme: The Finance Act 2019 reinstates the Export Expansion Grant (EEG) scheme, which provides incentives to SMEs engaged in non-oil exports. Under this scheme, eligible SMEs are entitled to a grant calculated based on the value of their non-oil export volume. The reintroduction of the EEG seeks to promote export-oriented activities and reduce reliance on oil revenues. Implication: The EEG scheme incentivizes SMEs to explore international markets and diversify their revenue streams through non-oil exports. By accessing the grant, SMEs can improve their competitiveness in the global market and boost foreign exchange earnings for Nigeria. 3. Pioneer Status Incentive: The Finance Act 2019 extends the pioneer status incentive to SMEs, offering qualifying businesses a tax holiday for an initial period of three years. SMEs engaged in pioneer industries that contribute to economic development and technology transfer may be eligible for this incentive. The pioneer status provides relief from corporate income tax, allowing SMEs to channel their resources towards growth and expansion. Implication: The pioneer status incentive encourages SMEs to invest in priority sectors and innovative industries, supporting economic diversification and sustainable development. SMEs can take advantage of the tax holiday to strengthen their competitiveness and establish a solid foundation for long-term success. 4. Minimum Tax Exemption: The Finance Act 2019 exempts SMEs with an annual turnover of 25 million Naira or less from paying minimum tax. Minimum tax is typically based on a percentage of gross turnover and applies regardless of profitability. By exempting qualifying SMEs, the Act reduces their tax burden and provides breathing space during early stages of growth. Implication: The minimum tax exemption provides a lifeline for SMEs during the critical initial years, allowing them to allocate resources strategically to expand their operations, hire more employees, and innovate. Conclusion: The Nigeria Finance Act 2019 demonstrates the government’s commitment to supporting SMEs as engines of economic growth and job creation. By providing tax incentives such as the VAT exemption threshold, the Export Expansion Grant (EEG) scheme, pioneer status incentives, and minimum tax exemption, the Act empowers SMEs to thrive in a competitive business environment. As an accounting firm in Nigeria, we encourage SMEs to take advantage of these tax incentives and leverage them to boost their financial resilience and competitiveness. By understanding and optimizing these provisions, SMEs can chart a path towards sustainable growth, contributing significantly to Nigeria’s economic prosperity and development.  Tax Reforms on SME’s: A discussion  The Nigerian government officially gazatted two major fiscal reforms, the deduction of tax at source withholding regulations 2024 and the value added tax modification order 2024.  These reforms introduce significant changes to tax landscape aiming to provide relief to businesses and support clean energy adoption. The withholding tax regulations Grant tax rate reductions and exemptions to businesses especially MSMEs with an annual turn over below 25 million naira with implementation beginning in January 2025. Now talking about the vat modification order 2024, it formalizes the suspension of VAT on diesel and extends vat exemptions to critical areas such as compressed natural gas electric vehicles bio gas and biofuel equipment emphasizing the continous shift toward clean energy for cooking and transportation. Now on the presidential committee on fiscal policy and tax reforms, they presented some of these recommendations to us earlier in May to stakeholders and media, I mean it's so good to see that some of these recommendations have been gazatted, what do you make of the process so far you know they had timelines, there was a three months, there was the six month how has it been so far for you? I expected that things would pan out exactly the way I've seen them, government is not the most straightforward and efficient in terms of ability to Implement things very quickly so when initially the presidential committee on fiscal reforms and tax policy commenced, the expectation was that it would last for about a year, in the Nigerian context that's almost impossible because you would have to engage several stakeholders and carry different people along and one of the things I will give you an insight into the process is this withholding tax regulations for example had been released in July right. There was a version that was out in June, July and people were wondering whether to implement or not to implement because it was not gazetted and we've waited since June July up till now to finally see one published, so I would say the performance overall of the committee has been good because within those restrictions and the bureaucracy of government they've been able to you know deliver some positive outcomes, you know some of them we've seen through executive orders and now these two you know gazetted orders in quick succession of the vat exemption, modification order and the withholding tax order, so I would say overall very good but the big one we're waiting for is the economic stabilization Bill, the final implementation because in there, there are several things that the committee, the big ticket items, that the committee has been working on, that implementation would crystallize, of course the one around tax identification and the harmonization of that. Harmonization very important especially in the context of the different tax authorities and agencies federal states and local governmenand for businesses, you know, dealing with several of them becomes a bit complicated, so, harmonization is one of the things the business Community has been calling for and then you would also see a reform of the various tax legislation, vat, withholding tax, you know rather company's income tax, even the petroleum industry Act, petroleum profits tax, capital gains tax, so what I understand is that there would be a total transformation and overhaul of the various tax legislation. Now let's talk about the vat modification order 2024, talk to us about you know the offerings and expected impact you know on the everyday Nigerian. So when I look at the bill even though it wasn't exactly stated there, well, the order not the bill, even though it's not exactly stated there, I see some very important strategies I think three of them, the first one is the recognition of the government of the challenges in terms of energy prices for Nigerians today so this is everything in the downstream petroleum space whether it be you know diesel, petrol, and even electricity, you know trying to deal with that and ensuring that at least from a fiscal side, the government is granting some relief, so recognizing the challenges for Nigerians and also responding to that, I think the other thing you know principle which I also uncovered there is that Nigeria recognized you know gas as a very important transition, you know element in achieving our Net Zero targets, so you know you can't just switch off from crude or hydrocarbons and Transit immediately to Renewables, and as you can imagine, Nigeria is largely a significant gas Reserve Nation so the ability to unlock that would be important and so the vat modification order sort of tries to incentivize the gas value chain by you know incentivizing the importation of equipment related to LPG, compressed natural gas, you know the bse's and all that. Then you know also recognizing the fact that we also need to achieve our Net Zero targets, you know Nigeria passed the climate change act a while back and one of the important targets is that by 2060 we would achieve Net Zero targets.  Well that is important I mean one of the things I did was also to measure the response of Nigerians on social media and I saw a lot of them asking questions about what about food, what about agriculture, what about health and all of those, are those captured here? because there has there have been a lot of announcements pronouncements so far so sometimes you know trying to put everything together can be a lot of work so talking about food whether it's agriculture or health where do all of this stand in this particular document you wouldn't see it in the document because and I think some work still needs to be done but currently most of the services in the health and medical space is already exempt from vat so you go see it a doctor or you're purchasing medical equipment all of that is vat exempt already and there was an additional executive executive order in June where the president announced that there will be no import duties and VAT on medical and pharmaceutical um equipment as well as inputs so that is already operational right same for food right basic food items are exempt but the Big Challenge from a Nigerian perspective is not the exemption for those items we expect them to be zero rated so the difference is that for Exempted items their costs will still have vat but for zero rated items their costs will also not have vat so every input in the value chain would be recoverable because it's zero rated to the customer and that's what businesses are expecting in that space so if you're exempting you're only reducing the vat on The Last Mile you have to remove the vat across the value chain and exemption doesn't do that my expectation is that when the overhaul of the vat act happens that those very critical elements like health education you know food they would be zero rated and that would you know ensure that the pricing structure across comes to the final consumer so for me I think that's key of course there's also an expectation like you would know because in the past this conversation had popped up whether the VAT rate was being going to be increased of course I mean I even heard him talk about it this morning on the station so he was also answering that particular big question so how about the fact that you know for things you've called nonessential and luxury we're going to have additional 2.5% has that started when is that starting is it part of this particular modification order that we've already seen this fat modification order doesn't touch on that so it will be the outcome of the economic stabilization bill so there's a lot of things to keep track of there's a lot as you can imagine to reform the fiscal space in this country you can't do it overnight so it would take a lot of effort but I think what need you know intends to do is to harmonize with the rest of the echas region because we are committed to that and that would you know mean that we have to increase our vat rate however the difference between Nigeria and the other countries in West Africa is that the ability to claim input vat is very limited in Nigeria so if government is going to increase the rate of vat on non-essentials my expectation is that they should expand the base on which businesses can claim relief for the vat they incure on their expenses when that happens I think businesses may not be too worried I think the other element that a common man would obviously raise an eyebrow to is you know the categorization of things called  non-essentials so if you put them inone bucket what about luxury items you know why would the Common Man be paying exactly the same value rate for things relating to you know even though they've removed it on transport but clothes and things like that but a yacht and a private jet is paying the same Vat rate a sound principle of fiscal policy would you know expect that government puts a bit more pressure on those luxury items in order to fund infrastructure for the poor and the vulnerable so for me I think that that would be one thing I would like to see I'm not so sure it's been sufficiently covered but I haven't seen the vat bill yet it will be interesting to see whether that's in there okay I think I forwarded something to you earlier but that's by the way now as there you know maybe some criteria or some things to consider before qualifying for certain things at the moment not well let me say first of all you know know the law is clear the law doesn't place a demand but practical implementation there might be practical requirements placed on people to claim some of these exemptions or benefits especially when you're importing so if you're importing you know some of these items you know as you can imagine at the Port the Nigerian Customs will want to be able to distinguish whether those items are used for the purpose which the exempt was granted or not so there is a process called the import Duty exemption where the grant a certificate through the Ministry of Finance where they look at the items that you're importing and check it against the exemption list so even though the law doesn't place that requirement you would see that the order also anticipates that the FIRS and the Nigerian Customs would come up with regulations and guidelines for how this will be implemented because you don't want to be give the incentive to the wrong people so I think the first thing to do to qualify is to be playing in that space. But there would also be some practical you know requirements from the federal Inland Revenue Service and the nigeran Customs Service. All right,  let's come to the withholding tax now I mean while it's a bit technical one of the aim of this particular one is also to you know simplify the process and make it less ambigous and all of that do you think that has been achieved looking at the document we have now as a tax practitioner. I'm a tax specialist so I've been doing this for 20 years plus it simplifies it for me right but you must appreciate that you know this is my life, there are some businesses that cannot afford consultants, for them I'm not so sure whether we have reached the level of Simplicity that's required but you know I must applaud the committee because they have dealt with some really thorning issues in relation to withholding tax one of them you know is in relation to Traders and manufacturers where they Supply their goods in the ordinary cost of business so the previous regulation says said that you know sales in the ordinary course of business was Exempted but the tax authorities because there was no definition of what constitute the ordinary cost of business, the tax authorities used to put pressure on businesses and say you must deduct withholding tax anyway otherwise you go to court you know for small medium Enterprises they're not inclined to go to court or be involved in such disputes so they pay, they're bullied into paying essentially so the committee has dealt with that issue. If you are a manufacturer your product will be 0% Exempted from withholding tax but if you're a Trader, say you're not the one manufacturing you're buying to sell then the withholding tax will be 2% and I think that's important, so withholding tax really is not a tax on its own, it's an early payment of income tax so you cannot be applying High rates of withholding tax to low margin businesses so this is why for passive income the rates are high 10% for services that are active it comes down and then if you then go down to Traders further goes down to 2% and then if you're manufacturing and selling it goes to zero and I think for me that's important because manufacturers today are under serious pressure in terms of economic headwinds they're dealing with effects they're also dealing with inflation and how much do you pass, how much of the inflation or the cost do you pass to the customers. customers do not even have the appetite or the capacity to pay for those items so their volumes are going down like you said energy and so on and so forth so a lot of them are posting losses so if you're now taking withholding tax on their supplies then they are paying taxes that are not due and I think the other thing this withholding tax regulation seeks to deal with is the issue of refund you know because it's not a final payment of tax they're supposed to take the credit notes and then recover itagainst their final income tax when they paying but if you have no tax to pay because your margins are low or eroded it then becomes very difficult to go to the tax Authority and say oh please grant me a refund because previously there was no budget for it or limited budget for it and everybody was asking from the same budget and the process was a bit opaque now what the committee has tried to do with this withholding tax order is to ensure that the refund process becomes simplified and that would provide a lot of solid to manufacturers and other players alike well there is a concern that some persons have raised with this especially when you talk about a 25 million naira threshold they are saying that the average you know uh sale price has gone up as a result of inflation and they are saying that this 25 million and you're talking about, I mean could be 50 million. What we don't do very often enough is reviewing thresholds so that threshold of 2 million naira was introduced by the finance act 2020 right. Since 2020 you know in 2020 what was the exchange rate it was probably 300 or 400 or something like that um what was the price of bread that time bread was probably 200 naira today if you want to buy bread the big Loaf it's about almost 2000 naira. so it therefore means that that threshold is not fit for purpose today but the government does not do the review of the thresholds often enough you know so as you can imagine for many small businesses 25 million naira is not a good threshold  and I have visibility of you know and that's why you raised the issue of businesses they've had to increase their prices and they cross that 25 million very easily but they are still very small businesses cottage industries you know salons you know shops and so doing 25 million 30 million and so on now if they have to be deducting withholding tax and pursuing all of this it doesn't help them. so I think what's the ideal amount for you. I think we have to work out I haven't done the calculations. We have to work out what the inflation has been since that time and come up with a new number I think it would you know be a minimum of double. I think there were a lot of opinions flying when the signed version came out but wasn't gazetted I think in less than 30 seconds, so I was very careful not to implement that for my clients why, because the substantive act actually says the minister, that there must be a writing to the taxpayers or the order must be gazetted, right now that it's been gazette and says implementation first of July 2025. I think that's what 2024 then January 2025 that's the the one that's in the apologies first January 2025 is the implementation date that's what we should hold on to the other one that says the tax authorities will come up with guidelines and go to the um Minister we don't have any insight into that um and I don't know or see the various tax authorities writing to have an inconsistent day because it would be very difficult to track you then have taxpayers that are effective 1 of July some that are later on and then some it would be so so messy and I don't think a case by case strategy by taxpayers would work because each time they go to the tax authorities they have to tax that they use the other one okay so so it's going to be too confusing so for me taxpayers just hold on to First January 2025 and Implement all right thank you so much.\n"

      "<h3>Understanding Business Name Reservation in Nigeria</h3>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Business name reservation in Nigeria is a process where an individual or organization can reserve a unique name for their business before officially registering it with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). This is done to prevent others from using the same name.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>According to the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), a business name reservation in Nigeria is valid for 60 days from the date of application. This means that if you apply for a business name reservation, you have 60 days to complete the registration process and pay the required fees.</p>\n",
