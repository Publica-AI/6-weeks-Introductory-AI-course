# Frameworks for AI Development

This course provides an overview of frameworks like LangChain that support the development of retrieval-augmented generation systems.


Here's a case study for a practical hands-on of what was in this course.


# Case Study 1: Chatbot Development for Customer Support in the Healthcare Industry  

## Background  
A private hospital is implementing an AI-powered chatbot to assist patients with appointment scheduling, FAQs, and symptom checking before visiting a doctor. The chatbot must provide structured and reliable responses while maintaining a professional and empathetic tone.  

## Tasks  

### Prompt Design  
- **Zero-shot Prompt:** Craft a prompt that enables the chatbot to answer common patient queries, such as hospital hours, accepted insurance, and doctor availability.  
- **Few-shot Prompt:** Create a prompt to guide the chatbot in providing empathetic responses to patient concerns about symptoms.  

### Structured Output  
- Design a **JSON output format** where the chatbot summarizes patient symptoms and suggests next steps (e.g., `"visit the hospital"`, `"self-care at home"`).  

### Advanced Prompting  
- Use a **chain-of-thought approach** to help the chatbot analyze symptoms before providing recommendations.

# Case Study 2: Content Transformation for E-commerce Marketing  

## Background  
An online fashion retailer wants to automate content generation for product descriptions across different platforms. The AI should generate engaging product descriptions for their website, concise social media captions, and SEO-optimized summaries.  

## Tasks  

### Prompt Design  
- **One-shot Prompt:** Write a prompt that transforms a raw product description into a compelling sales copy.  
- **Multi-step Prompt:** Create a prompt that refines descriptions based on tone (e.g., luxury, casual, trendy).  

### Structured Output  
- Format the output as a **table** with separate columns for:  
  - Product Name  
  - Long Description  
  - Short Caption  
  - SEO Keywords  

### Conditional Prompting  
- Develop a **conditional prompt** where the AI adapts the tone and content based on the target audience (e.g., **Gen Z vs. professional buyers**).
